## 📚 Common Reading Comprehension Question Types

A summary of the main types of reading comprehension and understanding questions that are used in reading tests (from school-level like TOEFL Junior, SAT, to advanced ones like GRE). Here’s a breakdown:


1. Factual / Detail Questions

- Ask for specific information stated directly in the passage.
- Clues: “According to the passage…,” “Which of the following is true…?”
- Example: What is the main cause of global warming mentioned in the passage?

2. Main Idea / Purpose

- Test if the reader can identify the central theme or author’s intent.
- Example: What is the main idea of the passage?
- Seen in: TOEFL, IELTS, GRE, SAT

3. Vocabulary in Context

- Understanding the meaning of a word or phrase as used in the passage.
- Example: The word “delicate” in line 4 most nearly means…

4. Inference Questions

- Require reading between the lines — answer is not stated directly but implied.
- Example: What can be inferred about the author’s attitude toward industry?
- Common in: GRE, GMAT, SAT

5. Reasoning / Cause-Effect

- Ask about why something happens or how two ideas are related.
- Example: Why are coral reefs at risk according to the passage?

6. Logical / Prediction

- Test ability to extend the logic of the passage to a new situation.
- Example: If industries continue to pollute, what is the most likely outcome?

7. Author’s Tone / Attitude

- Identify the emotion or stance of the author (neutral, critical, optimistic, etc.).
- Example: The tone of the passage can best be described as…

8. Structure / Organization

- Ask about how the passage is built (compare-contrast, cause-effect, narrative, problem-solution).
- Example: Which best describes how the passage is organized?

9. Application / Critical Thinking

- Apply ideas from the passage to real-world or new contexts.
- Example: What modern solution best matches the environmental issue discussed?

10. Summarizing / Synthesis

- Combine multiple details to capture the overall message.
- Example: Which statement best summarizes the passage?


### 🎯 Test Comparisons

- TOEFL / IELTS (English learners): Focus on main idea, detail, inference, vocabulary, author’s purpose.
- SAT / ACT (high school): Add evidence-based reasoning, logical predictions, analyzing arguments.
- GRE / GMAT (advanced): Emphasize critical reasoning, argument structure, author’s tone, inference.


### ✅ In short:

- Basic school tests (age 10–14): detail, main idea, reasoning, vocabulary.
- College prep tests (SAT/ACT): evidence, inference, logic, synthesis.
- Graduate-level (GRE/GMAT): deep critical analysis, structure, tone, logical flaws.

✅ This taxonomy lets you build a reading test framework:

- For your 11-year-olds → focus mostly on detail, main idea, cause-effect, vocabulary, simple inference.
- Slowly introduce tone, structure, prediction, application as they advance.
- For higher-level prep (SAT/GRE), emphasize argument analysis and logic.

## General-purpose Prompt (Intital Version)


Got it ✅ — you want to refine the instruction so that instead of being locked to only “nature, animals, global warming, etc.,” the LLM can randomly generate high-quality reading passages on a variety of school subjects (science, history, society, economics, etc.), but still keep the length, grade level, and test question requirements.


🎯 Refined Prompt

```text
Generate a high-quality English reading passage of about 800 words, written at a 7th grade reading level, on a randomly chosen topic from a wide range of school subjects (for example: science, nature, history, society, economics, technology, or culture). Choose a new subject each time you run the prompt

The passage should be engaging, clear, and informative, while suitable for testing the reading comprehension of an 11-year-old student.

After the passage, create 10 test questions that cover multiple skill types:

- Objective multiple-choice (factual recall)
- Subjective short-answer (explanation in own words)
- Reasoning/critical thinking (cause-effect, inference)
- Logical thinking (prediction, problem solving)

Provide answer keys for all questions.

```

### ✅ Example Variation Possibilities

- Science → ecosystems, electricity, inventions, space exploration
- Nature → climate, animals, oceans, forests
- History → ancient civilizations, world wars, famous leaders
- Society → culture, technology impact, education, communication
- Economics → trade, money, industries, globalization
