To control the load speed and batch size when loading data from Databricks to Elasticsearch (ES), you can use the following strategies:

1. Control Batch Size:
   
You can control the batch size by specifying the number of records sent to Elasticsearch in each request.

- In Spark: When using the Elasticsearch-Hadoop connector (org.elasticsearch.spark.sql), you can set the es.batch.size.entries and es.batch.size.bytes to control the size of each batch by the number of documents or the size in bytes, respectively.

```python
# Set batch size by the number of records (documents)
spark.conf.set("es.batch.size.entries", "1000")  # Default is 1000

# Set batch size by bytes
spark.conf.set("es.batch.size.bytes", "5mb")     # Default is 1mb
```

This will help you load data in smaller chunks, improving performance and preventing large requests that could overload Elasticsearch.

2. Control Load Speed (Throttling):

  
To control the speed at which data is loaded into Elasticsearch and avoid overwhelming the cluster, consider these settings:

- Bulk Processor Settings: Elasticsearch uses bulk processors to handle batches of indexing operations. You can control the bulk flush interval, size, and concurrency.

es.batch.write.retry.count: Retry attempts in case of failed writes.
es.batch.write.retry.wait: Time to wait between retries.
es.batch.write.refresh: Whether to refresh the index after each batch operation. Setting this to false can improve performance but delay the visibility of the data.
es.batch.write.concurrent.requests: Controls how many concurrent bulk requests are sent. Limiting this can help throttle the load.


```python
    # Set retry logic to improve throughput while maintaining reliability
    spark.conf.set("es.batch.write.retry.count", "3")        # Default is 3
    spark.conf.set("es.batch.write.retry.wait", "30s")       # Default is 10s

    # Control concurrency
    spark.conf.set("es.batch.write.concurrent.requests", "2")  # Default is 1
```

- Indexing Rate Limiting: Elasticsearch supports throttling by limiting the indexing rate using the _bulk API. To implement rate limiting, adjust the concurrency settings in the Spark job, ensuring the cluster isnâ€™t overloaded.
  

3. Use Data Partitioning:


To further optimize data loading and ensure Elasticsearch can handle the load efficiently, partition the data on the Databricks side.

```python
    # Example of partitioning data based on a column (e.g., date or id)
    partitioned_df = df.repartition(100)  # Adjust partition count based on the data volume

    # Write the partitioned DataFrame to Elasticsearch
    partitioned_df.write \
        .format("org.elasticsearch.spark.sql") \
        .option("es.nodes", "your_es_host") \
        .option("es.port", "9200") \
        .option("es.resource", "your_index/_doc") \
        .save()
```
Partitioning spreads the load and improves parallelism in data writing.

4. Adjust Elasticsearch Cluster Settings:
   
In some cases, adjustments on the Elasticsearch side can also help control the speed of data ingestion:

index.refresh_interval: Set this to a higher value (e.g., 30s or -1 to disable refreshing temporarily) to improve bulk indexing performance.

index.number_of_replicas: Reduce the number of replicas during indexing (e.g., set to 0) to speed up data ingestion, then restore it afterward.

```bash
    PUT /your_index/_settings
    {
    "index" : {
        "refresh_interval" : "30s",
        "number_of_replicas" : 0
    }
    }
```

* Summary:
- Batch Size: Use es.batch.size.entries and es.batch.size.bytes to control the number of records and data size in each bulk request.
- Speed Control: Adjust es.batch.write.concurrent.requests, es.batch.write.retry.count, and es.batch.write.retry.wait for load speed.
- Partitioning: Use data partitioning to spread the load evenly across the cluster.
- Elasticsearch Settings: Tune settings like index.refresh_interval and index.number_of_replicas to enhance performance during data ingestion.


These methods help you balance the load between Databricks and Elasticsearch, ensuring optimal performance while preventing overloading either side.
