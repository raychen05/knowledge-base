### Standard Operating Procedure

In IT and technology, SOP stands for Standard Operating Procedure. It is a set of step-by-step instructions that standardize how specific IT tasks or processes should be performed to ensure efficiency, consistency, and compliance.

Common Areas Where SOPs Are Used in IT:

1.	Infrastructure & System Administration
- 	Server setup and maintenance
- 	Network configuration and troubleshooting
- 	Database backup and recovery procedures

2.	Software Development & Deployment
- 	Code review and approval process
- 	CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) workflows
- 	Version control and branching strategies

3.	Security & Compliance
- 	User access management
- 	Incident response handling
- 	Data encryption and protection policies

4.	IT Support & Helpdesk
- 	Handling support tickets and escalations
- 	Software installation and troubleshooting
- 	Onboarding and offboarding procedures for employees

5.	Cloud & DevOps
- 	Provisioning cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- 	Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- 	Monitoring and logging best practices

Benefits of SOPs in IT:

- ‚úÖ Consistency: Ensures tasks are performed the same way every time
- ‚úÖ Efficiency: Reduces errors and speeds up processes
- ‚úÖ Compliance: Helps meet regulatory and security standards
- ‚úÖ Knowledge Retention: Makes it easier to onboard new team members

### Template of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 

Title: [SOP Title]

üìÖ Effective Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]
üìå Version: [Version Number]
üìÅ Department: [IT/DevOps/Security, etc.]
üë§ Owner: [Name/Team]


1. Purpose

Describe the purpose of this SOP.
Example:

	This SOP outlines the step-by-step process for deploying code to the production environment using a CI/CD pipeline.


2. Scope

Describe what this SOP covers and any limitations.
Example:

	This procedure applies to all software deployments managed by the DevOps team. It excludes manual hotfixes and emergency patches.   



3. Roles & Responsibilities

| Responsibility       | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| DevOps Engineer     | Ensures deployment is executed as per the SOP    |
| QA Engineer        | Validates the code before deployment              |
| Developer          | Merges code and triggers deployment pipeline      |
| IT Security        | Conducts security scans before approval          |

4. Prerequisites

List any requirements before following this SOP.
- 	Access to the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- 	Code reviewed and approved by at least one team member
- 	All automated tests must pass


5. Procedure

Step 1: Pull Latest Code from Repository

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Step 2: Run Automated Tests

pytest tests/

If any test fails, stop deployment and fix issues.

Step 3: Trigger Deployment
- 	Log into Jenkins
- 	Select the latest build
- 	Click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù
- 	Monitor logs for errors

Step 4: Verify Deployment
- 	Run post-deployment tests
- 	Check application logs
- 	Confirm no downtime


6. Troubleshooting & Common Issues

| Possible Cause                  | Solution                          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Deployment failed               | Missing environment variables     |
|                                  | Check .env file and update       |
| High latency after deployment   | Database migrations running      |
|                                  | Wait for completion or rollback  |


7. Escalation Process

If deployment fails and cannot be resolved:
	1.	Notify the on-call engineer
	2.	Rollback the deployment using:
