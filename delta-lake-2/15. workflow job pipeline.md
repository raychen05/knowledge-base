## A. Databricks Job vs. Pipeline: Concept and Differences


#### Databricks Job

A job in Databricks is a way to run a set of tasks (notebooks, JARs, Python scripts, or other workflows) on a Databricks cluster. It allows scheduling, monitoring, and automation of workflows.

**Key Features:**

-	Can contain multiple tasks with dependencies.
-	Supports retries, notifications, and execution history.
-	Can be triggered on a schedule or manually.

---

#### Databricks Pipeline

A pipeline in Databricks typically refers to Delta Live Tables (DLT) Pipelines, which are used for continuous or batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing.

**Key Features:**

-	Focused on data ingestion and transformation using Delta Lake.
-	Handles incremental data processing efficiently.
-	Manages data lineage, quality enforcement, and error handling automatically.

**Key Difference:**

-	A job is a general-purpose execution unit for running workloads.
-	A pipeline (DLT) is specifically designed for structured data processing and ETL workflows.

#### Difference Between Multiple Jobs in a Pipeline Project vs. Multiple Tasks in a Job


| Approach                                      | Description                                                                                   | Pros                                                                                      | Cons                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defining Multiple Jobs Under a Pipeline Project | Creating separate jobs for different components of a project (e.g., ingestion, transformation, reporting). Each job runs independently. | - Modular & scalable  <br> - Different scheduling & retry logic  <br> - Better separation of concerns | - Increased complexity in job orchestration  <br> - Harder dependency management |
| Defining Multiple Tasks Under a Single Job     | A single Databricks job with multiple tasks (e.g., extract, transform, load as separate tasks). Tasks run within the same job but can have dependencies. | - Easier to manage dependencies  <br> - Shared cluster usage reduces cost  <br> - Centralized monitoring & error handling | - Less flexibility in scheduling  <br> - Harder to scale if tasks become too complex |

---

#### Which One is Better?

Choose Multiple Jobs in a Pipeline Project if:

-	You need high modularity (different teams working on different components).
-	You want independent execution schedules for different parts.
-	You have long-running or resource-intensive tasks that need separate clusters.

Choose Multiple Tasks in a Single Job if:

-	Your tasks have strong dependencies and must run sequentially.
-	You want to reuse clusters to optimize cost.
-	You need centralized execution and monitoring in one place.

For most orchestrated data workflows, it‚Äôs common to use a single job with multiple tasks unless the components are too independent or require different runtimes.


---

## B.  Defining Multiple Jobs in a Databricks Workflow Pipelines Project

You have two options for defining multiple jobs in a Databricks Workflows Pipelines Project:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Separate job.yml file for each job
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define multiple jobs in a single job.yml file

---

üîπ Option 1: Separate job.yml for Each Job (Recommended for Large Projects)

-	Each job is independent, making it easier to maintain and test.
-	Better for large-scale projects with multiple jobs handling different tasks.
-	Ideal for CI/CD where jobs need to be deployed separately.

Example Directory Structure

```sh
databricks-workflow/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ ingestion-job.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ transformation-job.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ reporting-job.yml
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ ingestion.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ transformation.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ reporting.py
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ pipelines.yml  (Defines pipeline-level dependencies)

```


Example: jobs/ingestion-job.yml

```yaml
name: "Ingestion Job"
tasks:
  - task_key: "ingest_s3_data"
    notebook_task:
      notebook_path: "/Workspace/notebooks/ingestion.py"
    new_cluster:
      spark_version: "12.2.x-scala2.12"
      node_type_id: "i3.xlarge"
      num_workers: 2
```

---

üîπ Option 2: Define Multiple Jobs in One job.yml (Better for Small Projects)


-	All jobs are in one file, making it easier to manage smaller projects.
-	Easier dependency tracking if jobs are related.
-	Less flexible if jobs need to be updated independently.

Example: job.yml (Defining Multiple Jobs in One File)

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: "Ingestion Job"
    tasks:
      - task_key: "ingest_s3_data"
        notebook_task:
          notebook_path: "/Workspace/notebooks/ingestion.py"
        new_cluster:
          spark_version: "12.2.x-scala2.12"
          node_type_id: "i3.xlarge"
          num_workers: 2

  - name: "Transformation Job"
    tasks:
      - task_key: "transform_data"
        notebook_task:
          notebook_path: "/Workspace/notebooks/transformation.py"
        new_cluster:
          spark_version: "12.2.x-scala2.12"
          node_type_id: "i3.xlarge"
          num_workers: 2

  - name: "Reporting Job"
    tasks:
      - task_key: "generate_reports"
        notebook_task:
          notebook_path: "/Workspace/notebooks/reporting.py"
        new_cluster:
          spark_version: "12.2.x-scala2.12"
          node_type_id: "i3.xlarge"
          num_workers: 1

```


#### Which Approach is Better?

| **Criteria**               | **Separate `job.yml` for Each Job** | **Single `job.yml` for Multiple Jobs** |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Best for**               | Large projects with independent jobs | Small projects with related jobs |
| **Scalability**            | ‚úÖ Easier to scale                  | ‚ùå Harder to scale |
| **Job Dependencies**       | ‚úÖ Better isolation                 | ‚ùå Harder to isolate dependencies |
| **CI/CD Deployment**       | ‚úÖ Jobs can be deployed separately  | ‚ùå All jobs must be updated together |
| **Maintenance**            | ‚úÖ Easier to modify a single job    | ‚ùå Harder to manage large workflows |

- üëâ Use separate job.yml files if your jobs are large and independent (Recommended).
- üëâ Use a single job.yml file if your jobs are small and tightly coupled.

## C.  Databricks pipelines in workflows


Databricks pipelines in workflows are not limited to only live tables. They can be used for various purposes, including processing data from external sources like S3 for both batch and streaming workloads.

For a weekly job or S3 data source processing pipeline, Databricks workflows and pipelines are a good fit. Here‚Äôs why:


#### Benefits for Weekly Job / S3 Data Processing:

1.	Batch Processing:
-	Databricks pipelines can easily handle batch jobs, which are great for weekly processes. You can define tasks for ingesting data from S3, transforming it, and saving it back to your data lake or other storage systems.

2.	Orchestration & Scheduling:
-	You can schedule the pipeline to run at specific intervals (like weekly), and it allows you to orchestrate multiple tasks (e.g., data extraction, transformation, and loading).

3.	Scalability:
-	Databricks workflows can scale efficiently, whether you‚Äôre processing a small dataset or large volumes of data. You can define tasks that run on dedicated clusters, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

4.	Data Management:
-	Using Delta Lake or other formats, you can ensure ACID transactions and efficient processing. This is particularly useful when you‚Äôre dealing with large S3 datasets.

5.	Integration with S3:
-	Databricks integrates seamlessly with S3, so you can easily read from and write to S3 buckets in your pipeline tasks.

---

For your weekly job that involves S3 data sources and processing, using a Databricks pipeline in the workflow is generally a better option compared to defining a single job. Here‚Äôs why:


#### Why Use a Pipeline:

1.	Modular and Scalable:
-	A Databricks pipeline allows you to define multiple jobs as part of a single workflow. This is useful when you have a multi-step process (e.g., data extraction, transformation, and loading), which is common in data processing projects.
-	Scalability: As the project grows, you can add more jobs to the pipeline easily.

2.	Task Orchestration:
-	In a pipeline, you can define a sequence of tasks that need to run in a particular order. For example:
-	Task 1: Read data from S3.
-	Task 2: Transform the data.
-	Task 3: Write the processed data to S3 or a Delta table.
-	This kind of orchestration is hard to manage in a single job, especially when tasks depend on each other.

3.	Scheduling:
-	Pipelines in Databricks support scheduling, which is perfect for your weekly job. You can easily configure your pipeline to run on a set schedule (e.g., weekly) without needing to manage individual job timings.

4.	Error Handling and Retry Logic:
-	Pipelines allow you to manage errors and retries across jobs in the pipeline, making it easier to ensure that your process runs smoothly and recovers from failures automatically.

5.	Monitoring and Management:
-	With a pipeline, you get a centralized view of the jobs, making monitoring, logging, and debugging easier.


#### Why Not a Single Job:

-	A single job in Databricks is typically for simpler workflows, where everything can be handled in one go (e.g., just one task like data ingestion or a single ETL process). While a single job can work, it lacks the flexibility, modularity, and orchestration benefits provided by a pipeline.
-	Jobs are good for individual tasks but may not scale as well when you have multiple distinct tasks (like reading, processing, and writing data) that need proper dependency management and orchestration.

#### Recommended Approach:

-	Use a Databricks Pipeline for your S3 data processing project, as it allows you to define multiple tasks (jobs) in a logical sequence, handle scheduling, manage dependencies, and monitor the execution efficiently.

This approach will save time in the long run as your project scales, and ensure that your weekly data processing can be easily managed and automated.

---
In a Databricks Pipeline project, you should define multiple jobs under the pipeline rather than defining multiple tasks directly. 


1. Defining Multiple Jobs Under a Pipeline:
   
-	Pipelines are used to organize multiple jobs and their dependencies in a logical sequence. Each job can represent a specific task, like data ingestion, transformation, or loading, and you can define dependencies between jobs.
-	A pipeline helps you manage and orchestrate the sequence of jobs in your workflow.

2. Defining Multiple Tasks Under a Job:
   
-	Tasks are defined within a job. A job can have multiple tasks that run within the same execution context (e.g., using the same cluster). Tasks within a job are typically used when you want to break down a job into smaller sub-tasks, such as:
    -	Task 1: Extract data
    -	Task 2: Transform data
    -	Task 3: Load data
-	The tasks within a job can have dependencies on each other.


---

Example Structure:

-	Pipeline: Orchestrates the entire workflow.
    -	Job 1: Data Extraction (reads from S3)
    -	Job 2: Data Transformation (processes the data)
    -	Job 3: Data Loading (writes back to S3 or a database)

Each job can have tasks within it, and tasks can depend on other tasks to complete before they run.

Conclusion:
-	You will define multiple jobs in a pipeline, and each job can have multiple tasks. This provides modularity and flexibility for your workflows.
-	Pipelines are the higher-level construct for managing dependencies, scheduling, and orchestration of jobs. Jobs contain tasks that define the steps within that specific job.

---

Here‚Äôs an example Databricks pipeline project configuration (databricks.yml) that defines multiple jobs under a pipeline. This setup ensures modularity and clear separation of concerns for different parts of your data processing pipeline.

Example databricks.yml Configuration

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: DataProcessingPipeline
    target: dev
    clusters:
      - name: shared_cluster
        spark_version: 12.2.x-scala2.12
        node_type_id: i3.xlarge
        autoscale:
          min_workers: 2
          max_workers: 8

    jobs:
      - name: Data Ingestion
        tasks:
          - task_key: extract_data
            notebook_task:
              notebook_path: /Repos/data_team/extract_data
            cluster_key: shared_cluster

      - name: Data Transformation
        tasks:
          - task_key: transform_data
            notebook_task:
              notebook_path: /Repos/data_team/transform_data
            cluster_key: shared_cluster
            depends_on:
              - task_key: extract_data

      - name: Data Loading
        tasks:
          - task_key: load_data
            notebook_task:
              notebook_path: /Repos/data_team/load_data
            cluster_key: shared_cluster
            depends_on:
              - task_key: transform_data
```

---

Why Use This Approach?

-	Modular: Each job handles a distinct part of the pipeline.
-	Scalable: Jobs can be updated independently.
-	Dependency Management: Ensures that tasks run in the correct sequence.
-	Reusability: Each job can be re-executed without affecting others.

## D. Difference Between Defining Multiple Jobs in a Databricks Pipeline vs. Job Project 

In Databricks Workflows, you can define multiple jobs using YAML, but the approach differs depending on whether you‚Äôre working with a pipeline project or a job project. Below are the key differences:

--

1. Databricks Pipeline Project (Using pipelines.yml)

Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) Pipelines use a pipelines.yml configuration file. A pipeline is primarily used for processing structured streaming and batch workloads that update live tables.

Example: Defining Multiple Jobs in a Databricks Pipeline (pipelines.yml)

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: "Pipeline_One"
    continuous: false
    edition: "advanced"
    clusters:
      - label: "default"
        node_type_id: "Standard_DS3_v2"
        num_workers: 4
    libraries:
      - notebook:
          path: "/Workspace/Pipeline_One"
    target: "default_catalog.pipeline_one"
    
  - name: "Pipeline_Two"
    continuous: true
    edition: "advanced"
    clusters:
      - label: "default"
        node_type_id: "Standard_DS3_v2"
        num_workers: 2
    libraries:
      - notebook:
          path: "/Workspace/Pipeline_Two"
    target: "default_catalog.pipeline_two"
```

Key Features:

- ‚úÖ Designed for Delta Live Tables
- ‚úÖ Supports continuous or triggered execution
- ‚úÖ Managed by Databricks workflow engine
- ‚úÖ Defines multiple live tables and streaming jobs
- ‚úÖ Good for incremental and streaming workloads

---

2. Databricks Job Project (Using job.yml)

A Databricks job project allows you to define multiple batch jobs that are run using Databricks job clusters. These are used for scheduled workflows (ETL, batch processing, machine learning training, etc.).

Example: Defining Multiple Jobs in a Single job.yml

```yaml
jobs:
  - job:
      name: "Job_One"
      tasks:
        - task:
            name: "Extract Data"
            notebook_path: "/Workspace/Extract"
        - task:
            name: "Transform Data"
            notebook_path: "/Workspace/Transform"
            depends_on: ["Extract Data"]
  
  - job:
      name: "Job_Two"
      tasks:
        - task:
            name: "Load Data"
            notebook_path: "/Workspace/Load"
        - task:
            name: "Validation"
            notebook_path: "/Workspace/Validation"
            depends_on: ["Load Data"]
```

Key Features:

- ‚úÖ Used for batch jobs and ETL pipelines
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple independent or dependent jobs
- ‚úÖ Good for scheduled execution
- ‚úÖ Uses Databricks job clusters (instead of live tables)
- ‚úÖ Each job runs tasks in sequence or parallel

---

Which Approach is Better?

| Feature                          | Databricks Pipeline (pipelines.yml)                 | Databricks Job (job.yml)                   |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Use Case                         | Streaming & incremental data processing (DLT)      | Batch processing & scheduled ETL           |
| Execution Mode                   | Continuous / Triggered                             | Scheduled / Ad-hoc                         |
| Cluster Type                     | Managed pipeline clusters                          | Job clusters (can be shared or new)        |
| Statefulness                     | Supports live table updates                        | Stateless job execution                    |
| Best For                         | Streaming jobs, structured processing              | ETL workflows, ML training, reporting      |


Best Practice:

-	Use Databricks Pipelines (pipelines.yml) if you need streaming & incremental processing.
-	Use Databricks Jobs (job.yml) if you need scheduled ETL jobs, batch processing, or machine learning workflows.


---

Should You Define Multiple Jobs in One YAML File or Separate Files?

-	‚úÖ If jobs are closely related (e.g., part of the same workflow), define multiple jobs in a single job.yml.
-	‚úÖ If jobs are independent (e.g., different projects), use separate job.yml files for better modularity.

Example Directory Structure for Separate YAML Files:
```sh
databricks_project/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ pipelines/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline_one.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline_two.yml
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job_one.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job_two.yml

```

Conclusion

-	Use Databricks Pipelines (pipelines.yml) for live tables & streaming.
-	Use Databricks Jobs (job.yml) for batch ETL & scheduled workflows.
-	Choose one YAML file per project if jobs are related, or separate YAML files for independent jobs.
