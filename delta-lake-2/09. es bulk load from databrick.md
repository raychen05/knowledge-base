### A. JSON vs. Dataframe Format


Given that the index document in Elasticsearch is complicated with many nested fields and thousands of root fields, the choice between JSON and DataFrame becomes a bit more nuanced. Here’s a breakdown of the best format for this scenario:

---

#### Why JSON is Better for Complex Nested Structures

-	Native Support for Nested Structures: JSON is naturally designed to support nested objects and arrays. Elasticsearch indexes documents in a JSON format, so if you have complex nested structures, JSON is a natural fit for Elasticsearch.
    -	Elasticsearch understands and stores nested fields in a way that is very efficient when using JSON.
    -	The nested fields in JSON can be easily mapped to Elasticsearch’s nested data types, which is beneficial if your data includes deeply hierarchical structures.

-	Flexibility: JSON allows for variable field names and can easily accommodate dynamic structures.
    -	When dealing with thousands of root fields, JSON provides the flexibility to represent this complexity while maintaining a relatively simple format.
    -	Dynamic mappings in Elasticsearch can accommodate changes in the data structure without the need for predefined schema modifications.

-	Serialization: If you’re dealing with complex data structures, JSON can be serialized directly from DataFrames or RDDs in Spark, without requiring additional transformations.


---

#### Why DataFrame Might Not Be Ideal for Complex Nested Structures


- Flattening Needed for Complex Structures: DataFrames are inherently tabular, which makes them great for flat data structures, but not as efficient for nested JSON-like documents.
    -	If your data has a lot of nested fields, you’ll need to flatten the structure before loading it into a DataFrame, which can result in a loss of hierarchy and might require complex transformations.
    -	Complex nested data must either be exploded or flattened into multiple rows, losing its original nested relationships, which is not ideal for Elasticsearch.

-	Increased Processing Complexity: You’d need to handle the transformation of nested structures manually before writing the data in a DataFrame, which might involve extra computational resources and time.

-	Less Flexibility: While DataFrames support nested structures, they are typically more optimized for tabular data rather than JSON-like hierarchical data.


---

#### Best Practice Recommendation for Complex Nested Documents

For complicated index documents with a lot of nested fields and thousands of root fields, JSON is the recommended format for the following reasons:

-	Better alignment with Elasticsearch’s document model, which is based on JSON.
-	Efficient handling of complex nested fields without the need for flattening.
-	Simpler integration with the Elasticsearch index, since you don’t need to manage custom transformations between Spark DataFrames and nested JSON documents.

---

#### Optimized Approach

To load this complex nested data into Elasticsearch from Databricks Delta Lake:

1.	Use Spark DataFrame to read the Delta table.
2.	Convert the DataFrame into a JSON structure.
3.	Write JSON directly to Elasticsearch for indexing.

---

#### Scala Spark Code Example:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val spark = SparkSession.builder()
  .appName("ComplexESLoader")
  .getOrCreate()

// Define the Delta table path
val deltaTablePath = "dbfs:/mnt/datalake/your_table"

// Read the Delta table into a DataFrame
val fullDataDF = spark.read.format("delta").load(deltaTablePath)

// Convert the DataFrame to JSON (to preserve complex/nested structure)
val jsonDF = fullDataDF.toJSON

// Write the JSON to Elasticsearch
jsonDF.write
  .format("org.elasticsearch.spark.sql")
  .option("es.resource", "your_index/_doc")
  .option("es.batch.size.bytes", "10mb")
  .option("es.batch.size.entries", "5000")
  .option("es.mapping.id", "document_id")
  .mode("append")
  .save()

println("Data successfully indexed to Elasticsearch.")
```
---

#### Why This is Efficient:

-	JSON maintains the structure: By converting the DataFrame to JSON, you ensure that all nested fields and complex objects are preserved when indexing into Elasticsearch.
-	Direct Elasticsearch Integration: Elasticsearch natively accepts JSON, so you’re working with native formats that will be efficiently ingested by ES.
-	Handling of Complex Data: Nested fields within the JSON are preserved as nested structures in Elasticsearch, ensuring that your document hierarchy remains intact.

---

#### Summary

-	For complex, nested documents with thousands of fields, JSON is the best format due to its native support for Elasticsearch’s document model.
-	DataFrames should only be considered if you’re dealing with more tabular data or if you need to flatten the complex structure manually, which can lose the inherent hierarchy.

### B. ES Bulkload from Databrick


Yes, saving the document ID and the JSON document as a string in a Delta Lake table and then loading the data to Elasticsearch (ES) using the bulk load approach can be a very efficient strategy, especially when working with large datasets and aiming for high performance. Here’s a breakdown of why this approach works well and the key considerations:

---

#### Why This Approach is Efficient:

1.	Avoiding Unnecessary Processing:
-	Storing the JSON as a string in Delta Lake allows you to avoid the overhead of serialization/deserialization of complex nested structures during the write process.
-	This way, you don’t need to process the data multiple times. Instead, you can read it as-is from Delta Lake and send it directly to Elasticsearch in the format that Elasticsearch expects.

2.	Reduced Data Transformation:
-	By storing the JSON already in the correct format (as a string), you skip the need for complex transformations (such as converting DataFrames to JSON) before sending data to Elasticsearch.
-	You can directly use the bulk load approach to send multiple documents to ES efficiently.
	
3.	Leverages Elasticsearch Bulk API:
-	Elasticsearch’s Bulk API is highly optimized for performance. Sending large batches of documents in a single request reduces the network overhead and helps you maximize throughput.
-	When sending data as JSON strings, Elasticsearch can process the document exactly as it needs it without extra conversions.

4.	Parallelism and Scalability:
-	This approach allows you to take advantage of parallel processing in Databricks. You can process different partitions of your Delta Lake table independently, which can be sent to ES in parallel via bulk API requests.
-	If you need to split the data for loading in parallel, it can be done efficiently without additional overhead.

5.	Flexibility in Document IDs:
-	By storing the document ID as a separate field (or part of the string), you retain flexibility in managing IDs and can ensure that each document is properly indexed in Elasticsearch.


---

#### Considerations for Best Efficiency:


-	Bulk Size: When using the bulk load approach, ensure that the bulk size (both in terms of document count and payload size) is properly tuned.

    -	Too small a bulk size could increase the number of network requests and reduce throughput.
    -	Too large a bulk size can lead to timeouts and memory issues.
    -	Ideal bulk size can be around 5–10 MB per bulk request (for instance, 5000–10000 documents per request, depending on document size).

-	Retry and Error Handling: Bulk indexing operations should include error handling and retry logic in case of failed requests. Elasticsearch’s bulk API can return partial successes, so you need to ensure failed documents are retried.

-	Document ID Uniqueness: Ensure that the document ID is unique, as Elasticsearch will use this ID to determine whether to overwrite an existing document or add a new one. Storing the ID separately allows you to manage conflicts and ensure data integrity.

-	Data Partitioning: When working with a large dataset, ensure that the data in Delta Lake is properly partitioned for efficient reading. You can leverage Spark’s partitioning strategy to load data in parallel and distribute the bulk load efficiently across multiple threads.

---

#### Scala Spark Code Example:

Here’s how you can implement this approach in Databricks with Scala to bulk load JSON string documents to Elasticsearch:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("ESBulkLoad").getOrCreate()

// Define the Delta table path
val deltaTablePath = "dbfs:/mnt/datalake/your_table"

// Read Delta table into DataFrame
val df = spark.read.format("delta").load(deltaTablePath)

// Assuming Delta table contains `doc_id` and `json_str` (JSON string column)
val dataToLoad = df.select("doc_id", "json_str")

// Convert to RDD for efficient parallel processing
val rdd = dataToLoad.rdd.map(row => {
  // Construct the ES document bulk request payload
  val docId = row.getString(0)
  val jsonStr = row.getString(1)

  // Create the ES bulk action: we use the "index" action here
  s"""{ "index" : { "_id" : "$docId" } }
      |$jsonStr""".stripMargin
})

// Send the bulk load to Elasticsearch
rdd.foreachPartition { partition =>
  val bulkRequest = partition.mkString("\n")
  // Make sure the bulk request is properly formatted (JSON line by line)
  val esEndpoint = "http://your-es-cluster-url/your_index/_bulk"

  // Send the bulk request to Elasticsearch (can be done with HTTP client libraries like `requests` in Python or using the HTTP client in Spark)
  // Example using Apache HttpClient in Spark, or use your preferred ES client library

  // Your bulk loading logic (sending the data to ES, using HttpClient, etc.)
  // Example here could involve using an ES Spark connector or custom HTTP requests
}

// Example print statement to confirm
println("Data successfully indexed in Elasticsearch.")
```

---

#### Key Points to Focus on:

1.	Bulk API Format: The bulk API expects a specific format where each document is preceded by a metadata line (e.g., { "index" : { "_id" : "document_id" } }). This approach combines the metadata and the actual JSON document in the bulk request.

2.	Efficient Partitioning: Ensure the data is partitioned in such a way that multiple partitions are processed in parallel to maximize throughput.

3.	Custom Bulk Request Management: You can adjust the size of each bulk request (in terms of documents or size) based on your cluster’s capacity and the size of each document to achieve optimal load performance.

---

#### Conclusion:

-	Storing the document ID and JSON string directly in Delta Lake and using the Elasticsearch bulk load API is a highly efficient approach, particularly when dealing with complex, nested JSON documents.
-	This method minimizes transformations and overhead, while leveraging parallel processing in Databricks for optimal performance.
-	Just ensure that you carefully tune the bulk size and handle retries or errors appropriately during the bulk load to Elasticsearch.


---
### C. Optimal Number of Databricks Cluster Nodes


To determine the optimal number of Databricks cluster nodes needed to efficiently load 80 million documents into a 40-node Elasticsearch cluster with the bulk load approach, we need to balance between cost efficiency and performance. The main goal is to ensure fast processing without over-provisioning your Databricks cluster, thus minimizing costs.


---

#### Key Considerations:

1.	Parallelism and Bulk Size:
    -	The more parallelism you have, the faster the data can be processed and sent to Elasticsearch. However, the bulk size must be optimized to avoid network congestion and memory issues.
    -	Bulk requests typically range from 5MB to 10MB (or about 5000-10000 documents per request), depending on the average document size.

2.	Data Partitioning:
    -	Partitioning the data effectively in Databricks is critical to ensure each node handles an optimal amount of data. You can load the data in smaller chunks by reading from the Delta Lake table in partitions, allowing you to utilize parallel processing.

3.	Databricks Cluster Size:
    -	A smaller cluster will reduce costs but might slow down the bulk load, while a larger cluster will speed up processing but increase costs.
    -	Since you’re aiming for efficiency with minimal cost, 5-6 nodes with balanced configuration should be sufficient for your use case, as long as the data is partitioned well and the bulk requests are optimized.


---

#### Cluster Recommendations and Approaches

1. Cluster Type and Size:
    -	Recommended Databricks Cluster Size:
        -	5-6 Databricks nodes with 8-16 cores and balanced RAM (e.g., 32GB RAM per node).
        -	This allows you to achieve high throughput while maintaining cost efficiency.
    -	High-Performance (Optional):
        -	If you want to push the limits and achieve the fastest loading, you could scale up to 8-10 nodes (with 16-32 cores and high RAM), but this may be an overkill for your use case and lead to unnecessary costs.

2. Parallel Processing:
    -	Partitioning the Data: Partition the data in the Delta Lake table to match the number of nodes in the cluster. For example, if you have 5 Databricks nodes, partition your data into 5 parts so that each node processes one partition.
    -	This approach ensures that the bulk load happens in parallel, utilizing all available nodes.

3. Bulk Size and Load Efficiency:
    -	As mentioned, bulk size plays a big role in performance. A good starting point for bulk size is 5MB-10MB per bulk request, depending on the size of each document. This ensures that each request is large enough to be efficient but not so large as to overwhelm the network or Elasticsearch.

4. Cost Optimization:
    -	Since you’re focusing on cost-efficiency, consider using Spot instances (if available) in Databricks to reduce costs further while maintaining the necessary compute resources.
    -	Use auto-scaling to scale down the cluster when less processing is needed, which will help keep costs in check while still meeting performance goals.

---

#### Number of Nodes for Efficient Loading:

-	5-6 Databricks nodes should be sufficient for the 80 million documents, given:
    -	Balanced cost vs. speed configuration.
    -	Parallel processing by partitioning the data efficiently.
    -	Optimal bulk size and proper error handling.

---

#### Example Calculation for 5 Databricks Nodes:

-	If you have 5 Databricks nodes, and you partition your data into 5 parts, you are effectively utilizing parallel processing.
    -	Each node processes one partition, and you can send bulk requests in parallel.
    -	Assuming you send 5000 documents per bulk request and you have 80 million documents:
        -	Total bulk requests = 80 million / 5000 = 16,000 bulk requests.
        -	If each partition processes a reasonable batch size per unit of time, with 5 nodes handling this workload concurrently, the process should complete in a reasonable time without over-provisioning your cluster.

---
#### Summary of Cluster Setup:

| Cluster Type              | Databricks Nodes | Driver/Worker Type   | Parallelism Strategy                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Balanced (Cost vs. Speed)** | 5-6              | 8-16 cores, balanced RAM | Partition data into 5-6 parts and process in parallel using bulk requests |


---

#### Conclusion:

Using 5-6 Databricks nodes is optimal for your case, balancing cost and speed effectively. This size will allow you to achieve high performance with the bulk load approach, as long as you partition the data properly and adjust the bulk request size to ensure efficient data transfer to Elasticsearch.


---

### D. Partition Stratigies


The number of partitions should generally be calculated based on the number of **cores** rather than the number of nodes, since Spark performs work based on available cores, and it is the cores that process the data in parallel.


#### Key Concepts:

-	Partitions: These represent units of work for Spark. More partitions allow Spark to process more data in parallel.
-	Cores: The number of cores determines how many partitions can be processed concurrently. A core can process one task (i.e., a partition) at a time.


---

#### Parttion Setup:


1. Partition Count Relative to Cores:
 
-	Ideally, you want the number of partitions to be greater than or equal to the number of cores to fully utilize the parallelism of the cluster.
-	In your case, with 32 cores (2 nodes * 16 cores per node), 20 partitions would be a reasonable starting point.


2. Optimal Partition Strategy:

-	2 nodes with 16 cores per node and 20 partitions is a reasonable setup for your task, given that you are just sending data to Elasticsearch (ES), which doesn’t require significant data transformations or computations.
-	If the task is only about loading data into ES, then having fewer partitions (e.g., 20) can still be efficient, because the process is I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound. You may not need to fully maximize the number of partitions relative to the number of cores.


3. Cost Efficiency:

-	Using 2 nodes (16 cores per node) will cost you less compared to the 5-node setup. Since your data processing is primarily sending documents to Elasticsearch, the CPU resources might not be as critical as in more complex transformations.
-	Therefore, using 2 nodes with 16 cores per node for 20 partitions will likely be sufficient, and could also offer better cost-efficiency.


This setup should provide a good balance between cost and performance for your Elasticsearch loading task.


---
#### Example Scala Code:

To save an ID and JSON string (as a column) into a Delta Lake table using Scala, you can follow this approach:


```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import io.delta.tables._

val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SaveToDeltaLake").getOrCreate()

// Sample data (ID and JSON string)
val data = Seq(
  ("1", """{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}"""),
  ("2", """{"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"}"""),
  ("3", """{"name": "Bob", "age": 35, "city": "Chicago"}""")
)

// Create DataFrame
val df = spark.createDataFrame(data).toDF("id", "json_string")

// Define the path to your Delta Lake table
val deltaTablePath = "/path/to/delta/lake/table"

// Save the DataFrame to Delta Lake
df.write.format("delta").mode("append").save(deltaTablePath)
```


---

### E. Elasticsearch Bulk API vs. Elasticsearch-Hadoop Connector


Both approaches you mentioned for writing data to Elasticsearch (ES) in Databricks—using org.elasticsearch.spark.sql and sending data via Elasticsearch Bulk API—have their own use cases and performance characteristics. The best choice depends on your data volume, latency tolerance, and the complexity of your use case. Below is a comparison of the two approaches:

---

#### 1. Using org.elasticsearch.spark.sql (Elasticsearch-Hadoop Connector)

The org.elasticsearch.spark.sql connector is a straightforward way to write Spark DataFrames to Elasticsearch.

Advantages:
-	Simple to use: Directly integrates with Spark’s DataFrame API, making it easy to write DataFrames to Elasticsearch with minimal setup.
-	Optimized for Spark: The connector handles the data parallelism, partitioning, and distribution automatically.
-	Out-of-the-box integration: You can easily connect to ES, especially if your Elasticsearch setup is compatible with the connector.

Disadvantages:
-	Less control over bulk size: You have less control over the granularity of bulk requests and their configurations (e.g., bulk size, number of concurrent requests, retries).
-	Potentially higher overhead: The default writing behavior might not be optimal for very large datasets or highly customized ES configurations.

Usage Example:
```scala
// Assuming df is your Spark DataFrame
df.write
  .format("org.elasticsearch.spark.sql")
  .option("es.resource", "index/type")  // Specify your ES index and type
  .option("es.nodes", "your-es-cluster-url")
  .mode("append")
  .save()
```

---

#### 2. Using Elasticsearch Bulk API with Custom Code

When sending data to Elasticsearch via the Bulk API (using custom code), you typically have greater control over the exact behavior of the bulk operations, such as batch size, number of concurrent threads, retries, etc.

Advantages:
-	Better control: You can fine-tune the size of each bulk request, number of concurrent threads, and control retries, which is useful for optimizing performance and minimizing errors.
-	Can be optimized for massive data: You can experiment with different configurations (e.g., chunking data into smaller batches) to find the best performance for your specific ES setup.
-	Custom logic: You can implement specific logic for dealing with errors, retries, and even dynamic index mappings or document transformations before sending data to Elasticsearch.

Disadvantages:
-	Requires more coding: You need to handle the bulk request generation, splitting of data into batches, and managing any necessary error handling.
-	Complexity: It can be more complicated to implement and maintain compared to the org.elasticsearch.spark.sql connector, especially if you’re dealing with very large datasets.

Usage Example (Bulk API):

```scala
import org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.BulkRequest
import org.elasticsearch.client.Requests
import org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentType

// Assuming df is your DataFrame
df.foreachPartition { partition =>
  val bulkRequest = new BulkRequest()
  
  partition.foreach { row =>
    val json = row.getAs[String]("json_field")  // Example: extract JSON data from the DataFrame
    val id = row.getAs[String]("id")  // Example: extract ID
    
    // Create bulk request for each document
    bulkRequest.add(Requests.indexRequest("index_name")
      .id(id)
      .source(json, XContentType.JSON))
  }
  
  // Send bulk request to Elasticsearch
  if (bulkRequest.numberOfActions() > 0) {
    client.bulk(bulkRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT)  // `client` is your ES client
  }
}
```

---

####  3. Performance Comparison

-	Throughput: Using Elasticsearch Bulk API directly typically provides better performance, especially when you’re handling large datasets. The bulk API allows you to customize the batch size and control the number of concurrent requests, both of which can be optimized for the fastest throughput.

-	Efficiency: The bulk API allows you to send multiple documents in a single request, reducing the overhead and improving write throughput compared to one-by-one inserts. This can make a significant difference when writing millions of documents.

-	Latency: The org.elasticsearch.spark.sql connector may introduce higher latency for large datasets, as it abstracts the process and might not be optimized for maximum throughput like a custom bulk load approach.

-	Network Efficiency: Directly controlling bulk requests can allow you to minimize network overhead by sending the optimal number of documents per bulk request. This is more fine-grained than the default behavior in org.elasticsearch.spark.sql, which might not always match your specific performance tuning needs.

---

#### 4. Best Choice:

-	For simplicity and general use cases (especially for moderate data sizes): The org.elasticsearch.spark.sql connector is sufficient and quick to implement.
-	For high-performance use cases, where throughput and control over the bulk loading process are critical (e.g., loading large volumes of data efficiently), the Elasticsearch Bulk API approach is the better choice. It allows you to fine-tune the bulk request size, parallelism, retries, and error handling.


---

#### Conclusion:

-	If you need ease of use and are working with moderate data volumes, go with org.elasticsearch.spark.sql.
-	If you need maximum throughput and have control over your data volume, go with Elasticsearch Bulk API for fine-tuned performance.

For 80 million documents and 40 Elasticsearch nodes, I’d recommend the Elasticsearch Bulk API approach, as it will give you the flexibility to optimize performance for such a large-scale data load.


---

### Complete Scala Spark Code for Bulk Loading with ES API


To partition a Spark DataFrame and use the Elasticsearch Bulk API to load data to an ES cluster efficiently, you’ll need to incorporate several components into the code, such as:

1.	Partitioning the DataFrame: Spark partitions the data across multiple nodes.
2.	Bulk API Request: Sending data in bulk to Elasticsearch.
3.	Retry Mechanism: Handling failures with retries.
4.	Error Handling: Logging any errors or issues.
5.	Load Count Validation: Ensuring the correct number of documents are sent.
6.	Logging and Monitoring: Keeping track of the load process and reporting progress.


Here’s a complete example of the code that incorporates these features.

``` scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.elasticsearch.client.{Requests, RestClient, RestHighLevelClient}
import org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.{BulkRequest, BulkResponse}
import org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentType
import org.elasticsearch.client.RequestOptions
import org.apache.log4j.Logger

// Create Spark session
val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ES Bulk Load").getOrCreate()

// Set up logger
val logger = Logger.getLogger("ESBulkLoad")

// Initialize ES client
val esClient: RestHighLevelClient = new RestHighLevelClient(
  RestClient.builder(new java.net.HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http"))  // Update with your ES server details
)

// Read your DataFrame (example with a Delta table or any other format)
val df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/your/delta/table")

// Function to create and send Bulk requests
def sendBulkRequest(partition: Iterator[Row], esIndex: String): Unit = {
  val bulkRequest = new BulkRequest()

  partition.foreach { row =>
    try {
      val json = row.getAs[String]("json_string") // Example: Get JSON string from column
      val id = row.getAs[String]("id") // Example: Get document ID
      bulkRequest.add(Requests.indexRequest(esIndex)
        .id(id)
        .source(json, XContentType.JSON))
    } catch {
      case e: Exception =>
        logger.error(s"Error while processing row: ${row.toString}", e)
    }
  }

  // Only send the request if it contains actions
  if (bulkRequest.numberOfActions() > 0) {
    var retries = 0
    var success = false

    while (retries < 3 && !success) {
      try {
        // Send Bulk request to ES
        val bulkResponse: BulkResponse = esClient.bulk(bulkRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT)

        if (bulkResponse.hasFailures) {
          logger.error(s"Bulk request failed: ${bulkResponse.buildFailureMessage}")
        } else {
          logger.info(s"Successfully loaded ${bulkResponse.getItems.length} documents.")
          success = true
        }
      } catch {
        case e: Exception =>
          retries += 1
          logger.error(s"Error sending bulk request. Retrying ($retries/3)...", e)
          if (retries == 3) {
            logger.error("Bulk request failed after 3 retries")
          }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Function to monitor and log partition loading progress
def monitorAndLogStatus(totalRecords: Long, loadedRecords: Long): Unit = {
  val successPercentage = (loadedRecords.toDouble / totalRecords.toDouble) * 100
  logger.info(s"Load Progress: $loadedRecords/$totalRecords records loaded ($successPercentage%)")
}

// Validate the load count (check if all records are loaded)
def validateLoadCount(df: DataFrame, esIndex: String): Boolean = {
  try {
    // Count records in DataFrame
    val totalCount = df.count()

    // Get the document count from ES (assumes the ES index is named similarly to DataFrame)
    val countRequest = new org.elasticsearch.action.count.CountRequest(esIndex)
    val countResponse = esClient.count(countRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT)
    val esCount = countResponse.getCount()

    logger.info(s"Dataframe Record Count: $totalCount, ES Index Record Count: $esCount")

    if (totalCount == esCount) {
      logger.info("Record count validation passed!")
      true
    } else {
      logger.error("Record count validation failed!")
      false
    }
  } catch {
    case e: Exception =>
      logger.error("Error during count validation", e)
      false
  }
}

// Partitioning the DataFrame and processing each partition
val partitionCount = 20  // Set based on your available cores or partitioning strategy
val esIndex = "your_es_index"

// Save data in parallel using foreachPartition
df.repartition(partitionCount).foreachPartition { partition =>
  sendBulkRequest(partition, esIndex)
  monitorAndLogStatus(df.count(), partition.size)
}

// Validate the load count after the entire process
validateLoadCount(df, esIndex)

// Close the ES client connection
esClient.close()

spark.stop()

```

Considerations for Performance:

-	Partition Size: Adjust the partition size based on your cluster’s resources. More partitions allow higher parallelism but might lead to overhead.
-	Bulk Size: Tune the bulk size (XContentType.JSON) for optimal performance. This can significantly impact throughput.
-	Retries: Make sure the retry count and delay between retries are tuned for your environment to handle intermittent failures efficiently.

### Enhance Scala Spark Code for Bulk Loading with ES API


To enhance the bulk load process and make it more robust, we can add the following features:

1.	Retry Count Exceeded Logic:
-	If the number of retries exceeds the limit, instead of halting the loading process, save the failed document to a new DataFrame for later review and reloading.

2.	Threshold for Failed Documents:
-	After processing all documents, check the percentage of failed documents. If the number of failed documents is greater than 5% of the total documents, stop the load process and handle the failed documents appropriately.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.elasticsearch.client.{Requests, RestClient, RestHighLevelClient}
import org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.{BulkRequest, BulkResponse}
import org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentType
import org.elasticsearch.client.RequestOptions
import org.apache.log4j.Logger
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

// Create Spark session
val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ES Bulk Load").getOrCreate()

// Set up logger
val logger = Logger.getLogger("ESBulkLoad")

// Initialize ES client
val esClient: RestHighLevelClient = new RestHighLevelClient(
  RestClient.builder(new java.net.HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http"))  // Update with your ES server details
)

// Read your DataFrame (example with a Delta table or any other format)
val df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/your/delta/table")

// Initialize a DataFrame to store failed records
var failedRecords = spark.emptyDataFrame

// Function to create and send Bulk requests
def sendBulkRequest(partition: Iterator[Row], esIndex: String): Unit = {
  val bulkRequest = new BulkRequest()
  var partitionFailedRecords = Seq.empty[Row] // To store failed records in the partition

  partition.foreach { row =>
    try {
      val json = row.getAs[String]("json_string") // Example: Get JSON string from column
      val id = row.getAs[String]("id") // Example: Get document ID
      bulkRequest.add(Requests.indexRequest(esIndex)
        .id(id)
        .source(json, XContentType.JSON))

#### Key Changes and Additions:

1.	Failed Records DataFrame:
-	A failedRecords DataFrame is maintained to track failed documents from each partition. If retries exceed the limit, the document is added to this DataFrame for later review and reloading.

2.	Retry Count Exceeded Logic:
-	After the retry limit is reached (3 retries in this case), the document is saved in the failedRecords DataFrame.

3.	5% Failure Threshold:
-	The shouldStopLoading function checks if the failure rate exceeds 5% of the total records loaded. If it does, the loading process is halted to prevent a large amount of failed data from being loaded.

4.	Final Check of Failed Records:
-	After the loading process completes, the number of failed records is checked. If there are any failed records, additional handling (like retrying the failed records) can be done.



1.	retryFailedRecords Function:
-	This function takes the failedRecords DataFrame and retries loading the failed documents by repartitioning the DataFrame and sending bulk requests to ES.
-	The function checks if the failed records after retries exceed the 5% threshold. If they do, it stops the loading process.

2.	Retry Logic:
-	After all partitions have been processed, if there are any failed records, the code retries those records.
-	The failed documents are reprocessed by calling sendBulkRequest again, and logging is updated accordingly.

3.	Failure Monitoring:
-	Throughout the loading process, the system monitors failure rates using shouldStopLoading. If the failure rate exceeds 5%, the loading stops.

4.	Final Check and Retry:
-	After all partitions are processed, and if there are still failed records, retryFailedRecords is called to attempt reloading those documents.



#### Considerations:

-	Failure Rate: The 5% threshold can be adjusted based on your environment and tolerance for failures. For critical systems, you might want a lower threshold.
-	Retry Logic: The retry logic is limited to 3 retries in this example. You may adjust it to fit your performance requirements.
-	Failed Record Handling: Depending on the number of failed records, you may want to store them separately, retry them later, or notify stakeholders of the issue.



-	Retry Count: You can adjust the retry logic to attempt reloading failed records multiple times, depending on your needs.
-	Performance: Retrying failed records will require additional resources, so ensure that the cluster has sufficient capacity to handle retries.
-	Failure Threshold: You can adjust the failure threshold percentage based on your tolerance for failure.


This enhanced approach ensures that failed documents are not left behind and provides a mechanism for retrying them, making the loading process more robust and fault-tolerant.
