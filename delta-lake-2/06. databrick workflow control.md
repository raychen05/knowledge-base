### Running Multiple Jobs in Databricks with Workflow Dependencies: Shared or Separate Clusters?

When running multiple jobs in Databricks Workflows, you can choose between:
- 1️⃣ Using the Same Cluster for All Jobs
- 2️⃣ Using Separate Clusters for Each Job

---

📌 1. Using the Same Cluster for All Jobs

✔ Best for: Faster execution, optimized resource usage
❌ Downsides: Potential resource contention

✅ How It Works?
-	All jobs run on the same Databricks cluster.
-	Jobs can share cached data and resources.
-	No additional cluster spin-up time.

🔹 Example Configuration (Using Same Cluster)

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow with Shared Cluster",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_key": "job_A",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobA" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>"
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_B",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobB" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>"
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_C",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobC" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>",
      "depends_on": [{ "task_key": "job_A" }, { "task_key": "job_B" }]
    }
  ]
}

```

✔ Effect:
-	Job A & Job B run in parallel on the same cluster.
-	Job C starts only after Job A & Job B complete.

💡 Use when jobs share large datasets in Delta Lake.

📌 2. Using Separate Clusters for Each Job

✔ Best for: Resource isolation, better stability
❌ Downsides: Higher cost, additional cluster spin-up time

✅ How It Works?
-	Each job runs on its own dedicated cluster.
-	No resource contention between jobs.
-	Cluster settings can be customized per job.

🔹 Example Configuration (Separate Clusters)

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow with Separate Clusters",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_key": "job_A",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobA" }
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_B",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobB" }
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_C",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobC" },
      "depends_on": [{ "task_key": "job_A" }, { "task_key": "job_B" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

✔ Effect:
-	Each job runs on its own cluster.
-	No resource contention, but slower startup due to cluster initialization.

💡 Use when jobs require different compute configurations.

📌 3. Which One to Choose?


Option|	Use When|	Pros|	Cons|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
Same Cluster	|Jobs share data & resources|	Faster execution, reduced cost|	Possible resource contention|
Separate Clusters|	Jobs have different compute needs|	No contention, stable	|Higher cost, slower startup|


- ✅ For most workflows → Use the same cluster if jobs are lightweight & interdependent.
- ✅ For heavy workloads → Use separate clusters to avoid bottlenecks.

🚀 Hybrid Approach:
-	Use the same cluster for small/medium jobs.
-	Use separate clusters for heavy ETL workloads like model training or massive transformations.

###  Running Multiple Jobs vs. Running Multiple Tasks in One Job: Performance & Trade-offs


When orchestrating workflows in Databricks, you can choose between:
- 1️⃣ Running Multiple Jobs (Independent Jobs per Task)
- 2️⃣ Running Multiple Tasks in One Job (Job with Multiple Tasks)


---

📌 1. Running Multiple Jobs (Independent Jobs per Task)

Each task is configured as a separate Databricks job, and dependencies are managed at the job level.

✅ Pros:

- ✔ Better Resource Isolation → Each job runs on its own cluster (if needed), avoiding resource contention.
- ✔ Granular Failure Handling → If one job fails, others are not impacted.
- ✔ Flexible Scheduling → Jobs can have different triggers, retries, or schedules.
- ✔ Different Cluster Configurations → Customize clusters per job (e.g., different node sizes, memory, libraries).

❌ Cons:

- ❌ Higher Cost → Spinning up separate clusters per job leads to higher costs.
- ❌ Slower Execution → Cluster spin-up time can delay execution if using separate clusters.
- ❌ More Complex Orchestration → Dependency management needs additional setup via Databricks Workflows or external orchestrators like Apache Airflow.

🚀 Best Use Cases:

- ✅ Large, independent workloads that need separate compute environments.
- ✅ Workflows with different compute requirements per step (e.g., one job uses GPU, another uses CPU).
- ✅ ETL Pipelines processing high-volume data where each step is heavy and resource-intensive.

---

📌 2. Running Multiple Tasks in One Job (Job with Multiple Tasks)

Here, multiple tasks (notebooks, JARs, Python scripts) are executed within a single Databricks job. Dependencies are defined inside the job.

✅ Pros:

- ✔ Lower Cost → Tasks share the same cluster, reducing costs.
- ✔ Faster Execution → No cluster spin-up delay between tasks.
- ✔ Simplified Orchestration → Manage dependencies within one job without external tools.
- ✔ Easier Monitoring → One job to monitor instead of multiple separate jobs.

❌ Cons:

- ❌ Resource Contention → Multiple tasks sharing the same cluster may slow down performance.
- ❌ Limited Flexibility → All tasks must run on the same cluster type and version.
- ❌ Failure Handling → If a cluster crashes, all tasks within the job fail.

🚀 Best Use Cases:

- ✅ Smaller, interdependent workloads that process manageable data sizes.
- ✅ Use cases where cost optimization is crucial, and clusters can be shared efficiently.
- ✅ Scenarios where rapid execution is needed without waiting for new clusters to spin up.

📊 Performance & Trade-off Summary


| **Factor**           | **Multiple Jobs** 🚀 | **Multiple Tasks in One Job** ⚡ |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (cluster startup per job) | Faster (shared cluster) |
| **Resource Usage**  | More resources (each job may use its own cluster) | Less efficient if too many tasks run on the same cluster |
| **Cost**            | Higher (more clusters = more cost) | Lower (one cluster shared) |
| **Orchestration Complexity** | More complex (managing dependencies across jobs) | Simpler (all dependencies managed within one job) |
| **Failure Isolation** | High (one job failure doesn’t impact others) | Lower (one failure can stop all tasks) |
| **Flexibility**      | High (different clusters, libraries, configurations per job) | Low (all tasks share the same cluster config) |

💡 Which Approach to Choose?

🚀 Choose Multiple Jobs when:
- ✅ Large data processing workloads with different cluster needs.
- ✅ Jobs require different compute configurations (e.g., GPU for ML, large memory for ETL).
- ✅ Workloads are independent and can run on separate schedules.

⚡ Choose Multiple Tasks in One Job when:
- ✅ You need to reduce cluster costs and optimize resource usage.
- ✅ Tasks are lightweight and interdependent (e.g., reading, transforming, and writing small data).
- ✅ You want faster execution without waiting for cluster startup.

🚀 Hybrid Approach → Run lightweight tasks in a single job but use separate jobs for heavy workloads to balance cost, speed, and flexibility.
