## Processing a Small Subset on Large Delta Tables 


Good question üëå ‚Äî this is a very common scenario in Delta Lake pipelines:

You have a very large Delta table (80M+ rows), and for incremental processing, you only need to process a subset of records identified by UIDs (1 M ‚Äì 10 M), typically coming from an upstream change table, Kafka stream, or staging area.

üëâ The key is to avoid reading all 80M rows into a Spark DataFrame unnecessarily.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of efficient patterns you can use, depending on your infrastructure üëá



**Key principles:**
- Avoid scanning all 80M rows.
- Use Spark‚Äôs broadcast join and data skipping/Z-Ordering to reduce shuffle and I/O.


**Scenario**

- Main Delta table: `fact_table` (~80M rows)
- Incremental subset: `update_table` (1 M ‚Äì 10 M rows), e.g., changed entity keys
- Goal: Efficiently join/filter `fact_table` with `update_table` to process only relevant records

---

### üß† 1: Cache and broadcast `update_table`

- Use DataFrame.join with broadcast() if the UID subset fits in memory (1 M is usually fine)

If your UID subset is reasonably small (‚â§ 10 M is often OK on a decent cluster), the most efficient pattern is to:

- 	Read only the UID subset into a DataFrame.
- 	Broadcast join it against the large Delta table to avoid a full shuffle.


Since `update_table` is small (‚â§ 10 M rows), Spark can broadcast it to all worker nodes, preventing shuffling of the large `fact_table`.

```python
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame

// Subset of UIDs (incremental set), e.g., from S3 or another delta table
val utDF = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/delta/update_table")

// Optional: select only UID column if you only need filtering
val utUidDF = utDF.select("uid").distinct()

// Read the large delta table
val baseDF = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/delta/fact_table")

// Broadcast the UID subset to avoid shuffle
val filteredDF = baseDF.join(
  broadcast(utUidDF),
  Seq("uid"),
  "inner"
)

// Now process only the matched records
// e.g., transform, merge, write, etc.
```


üëâ Why this works efficiently:
- 	Spark sends the UID subset to all executors as a small hash table.
- 	Each executor scans its portion of the Delta table and filters locally, no large shuffle.
- 	Reading the large table is parallelized and filtered immediately.
-	No shuffle on the large fact_df.
-	Only relevant rows from fact_df are processed.

üëâ Best for:
- 	1 M ‚Äì 10 M UID list.
- 	You can afford to broadcast this once per incremental run.
-   With 1M keys, this is much faster than shuffling 80M rows.

---

### üß† 2. Use IN / SEMI JOIN filtering when you only need to filter by UID, not join extra columns

If you only need to select records in the large table matching a set of UIDs, a left semi join is even cheaper than a full inner join:

```scala
val filteredDF = baseDF.join(
  broadcast(utUidDF),
  Seq("uid"),
  "left_semi"
)
```

‚úÖ This keeps only rows in baseDF with a matching uid in utUidDF.

No extra columns pulled in ‚Üí less shuffle, less serialization.

---

‚úÖ  Use DataFrame.filter with isin() for very small UID subsets

If the subset is small (e.g., < 50 K), you can even collect to the driver and use .filter(col("uid").isin(...)):

```scala
val uidSet = utUidDF.collect().map(_.getString(0))
val filteredDF = baseDF.filter(col("uid").isin(uidSet: _*))
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt do this for millions of UIDs ‚Äî you‚Äôll blow up the driver memory.


---


###  üß† 3: Push filters down to Delta read

If fact_table is partitioned, always push filters on the partition column first to prune files before the join.

For example, if the table is partitioned by year or country:

```python
fact_df = (
    spark.read.format("delta")
    .load("/path/to/fact_table")
    .where("year >= 2020")   # partition pruning
)
```

---

#### üß† 4. Use Z-Ordering or Partitioning by UID or UID prefix to prune data at scan time

For recurring queries that filter by uid, you can physically optimize the Delta table to minimize the amount of data read:


#### Option A ‚Äî Partition by UID prefix (e.g., hash)

- 	Add a derived column, e.g., uid_bucket = uid % 1000.
- 	Partition the Delta table by uid_bucket.
- 	During incremental loads, pre-compute which buckets are needed and only read those partitions.

```scala
val neededBuckets = utUidDF
  .withColumn("uid_bucket", col("uid") % 1000)
  .select("uid_bucket").distinct().collect().map(_.getInt(0))

val baseDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .load("/mnt/delta/large_table")
  .where(col("uid_bucket").isin(neededBuckets: _*))

val filteredDF = baseDF.join(broadcast(utUidDF), Seq("uid"), "inner")
```
‚úÖ Spark prunes entire partitions at read time ‚Äî very fast if partitioning is well-designed.


#### Option B ‚Äî Z-ORDER by UID

If this join happens frequently, Z-ORDERing your Delta table on the join key (id) will greatly improve data skipping, meaning Spark will read fewer data files for matching keys:

If partitioning by UID isn‚Äôt practical, Z-Ordering is a good compromise:

```sql
OPTIMIZE large_table ZORDER BY (uid)
```

- 	Spark reorganizes Parquet files internally to cluster rows with similar UIDs.
- 	Future filters by UID can skip entire files using data skipping statistics.
- 	Combine with broadcast join for best effect.

This clusters related rows together in fewer data files, so Spark can skip non-relevant files during the read.

üí° Best for repeated incremental jobs, not for one-time.

---

### üß† 5. Use table_changes / CDF if UT comes from recent updates

If the UT set corresponds to recent changes in the Delta table (e.g., last hour/day), enable Change Data Feed:

```sql
ALTER TABLE large_table SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true);
```

Then read only changes since last processed version:

```scala
val changesDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
  .option("startingVersion", lastProcessedVersion)
  .table("large_table")

val filteredDF = changesDF.join(broadcast(utUidDF), Seq("uid"), "inner")
```

‚úÖ You avoid scanning the entire large table entirely ‚Äî ideal if UT is aligned with upstream changes.


---

### üß†  6 Optional ‚Äî Pre-filter fact_df using update_df keys

If the join key has good selectivity and is indexed / sorted, you can pre-filter using IN or semi join. Example:

```python
# Extract keys as a Python list (if very small) or keep as DF if ~100K
update_keys = update_df.select("id")

filtered_fact_df = fact_df.join(
    broadcast(update_keys),
    on="id",
    how="inner"
)
```

Or using a semi-join (less overhead):

```python
filtered_fact_df = fact_df.join(
    broadcast(update_df),
    on="id",
    how="left_semi"  # keeps only fact rows with matching keys
)
```

This is especially efficient if the id column is indexed through Z-ORDER or clustering (next step).


---


###  üß† 7  Tune Shuffle Partitions

Since your incremental set is small, avoid creating thousands of shuffle partitions unnecessarily:

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
```

You can adjust 200 to a lower number if the incremental workload is tiny. This prevents Spark from over-partitioning small outputs.


---

### üß† 8  Optionally, Use Bloom Filters (Delta feature)

If you have a large Delta table and the join key is highly selective, you can create a Bloom filter index on the join key column. Spark will then skip files that definitely don‚Äôt contain relevant keys:


```sql
CREATE BLOOMFILTER INDEX bf_idx ON TABLE fact_table FOR COLUMNS(id) OPTIONS ('fpp' = '0.1', 'numItems'='100000000');
```
Then Spark will use this index during joins/filter to avoid reading unnecessary files.

üöÄ Recommended Hybrid Strategy

For your case (UT = 1 M ‚Äì 10 M, large table = 80 M):

1.	Broadcast the UT UID subset.
2.	Z-ORDER the large table by uid to maximize pruning.
3.	Use left semi join to filter efficiently.
4.	If possible, combine with partitioning by hash buckets to avoid full scans.
5.	For future incremental runs, consider CDF if the UT represents recent changes.

---

### üß™ Example end-to-end code

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

# Load incremental keys
update_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/update_table").cache()

# Load large table with partition pruning
fact_df = (
    spark.read.format("delta")
    .load("/path/to/fact_table")
    .where("year >= 2020")
)

# Efficient join
result_df = fact_df.join(
    broadcast(update_df),
    on="id",
    how="inner"
)

# Process result
result_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/path/to/output")

```

‚ö° Performance Tips

- 	Broadcast joins work best when the smaller table < ~100MB compressed.
- 	Use explain() to confirm Spark plans show BroadcastHashJoin.
- 	Use OPTIMIZE + ZORDER periodically, not in every run.
- 	Avoid collect() on 100K keys if it can fit as broadcast DF.

## Optimizations when working with large Delta Tables


Great question üëå ‚Äî this is one of the most important optimizations when working with large Delta tables.

Short answer:

- ‚ùå No, you don‚Äôt need to load all data from the Delta table to update a small subset.
- ‚úÖ You should target and update only the impacted subset using MERGE, partition pruning, or semi-joins ‚Äî without reading the entire table into a DataFrame first.
- 

Let‚Äôs break this down carefully üëá


---

### üß† Scenario

- 	Large Delta table: main_table (80+ million rows)
- 	Incremental dataset: updates_df (e.g., 100K rows to insert/update/delete)
- 	You want to update only those 100K impacted rows.

---

### ‚ùå Inefficient Pattern ‚Äî Full Table Load + Update Subset

```python
# ‚ùå This loads ALL 80M rows into memory unnecessarily
main_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/main_table")

# Then tries to update subset by join / filter
updated_df = (
    main_df.alias("m")
    .join(updates_df.alias("u"), "id", "left_outer")
    # ... update logic ...
)
```

üî∏ Why this is bad:

- 	Full table scan every run ‚Üí heavy I/O.
- 	Shuffles & joins on massive dataset even if only 0.1% of rows change.
- 	Memory pressure and slow jobs.

---

### ‚úÖ Efficient Pattern ‚Äî Use Delta MERGE INTO with Incremental DF

Delta Lake supports ACID upserts directly on the Delta table. You don‚Äôt need to load the main table into a DataFrame. Instead, push your incremental changes to Delta‚Äôs storage engine to do the update efficiently:

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

# Load your incremental dataset
updates_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/updates")

# Point to the existing Delta table (without reading it fully)
delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/main_table")

# Perform MERGE (UPSERT)
(
    delta_table.alias("t")
    .merge(
        updates_df.alias("s"),
        "t.id = s.id"   # join key
    )
    .whenMatchedUpdateAll()       # or .whenMatchedUpdate(...) for selective columns
    .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()    # handle new rows if needed
    .execute()
)
```

‚úÖ What happens under the hood:

- 	Delta scans only files that contain matching keys (using partition pruning, Z-order, or bloom filters if present).
- 	It rewrites only affected data files.
- 	No need to materialize the full table as a Spark DataFrame.

‚ö° This is the most scalable way to update a small subset in a large Delta table.


---


### ‚úÖ Optional ‚Äî Target Subset with Pre-Filter (for extra efficiency)

If your table is partitioned, add filters on partition columns to minimize file scanning:

```python
(
    delta_table.alias("t")
    .merge(
        updates_df.alias("s"),
        "t.id = s.id AND t.year = s.year"   # partition column helps pruning
    )
    .whenMatchedUpdateAll()
    .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()
    .execute()
)
```

If you have Z-ORDER or bloom filters on id, Delta will also skip irrelevant files efficiently.

---


### ‚úÖ For Deletes or Partial Updates

Delta supports whenMatchedDelete() or column-level update logic:

```python
(
    delta_table.alias("t")
    .merge(updates_df.alias("s"), "t.id = s.id")
    .whenMatchedUpdate(set = {
        "col1": "s.col1",
        "col2": "s.col2"
    })
    .whenNotMatchedInsert(values = {
        "id": "s.id",
        "col1": "s.col1",
        "col2": "s.col2"
    })
    .execute()
)
```

---

### ‚úÖ If Only Deletes (e.g., tombstones)

```python
(
    delta_table.alias("t")
    .merge(deletes_df.alias("s"), "t.id = s.id")
    .whenMatchedDelete()
    .execute()
)
```


---

### üìä Summary


| Approach                          | Reads full table? | Efficient for large tables? | Best use case                |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Full load ‚Üí join ‚Üí overwrite       | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå No                       | Rare (only for small tables) |
| MERGE INTO with incremental DF     | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                      | Incremental upserts          |
| DELETE / UPDATE SQL                | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                      | Targeted deletes/updates     |
| Partition + ZORDER / Bloom filters | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Very                     | Repeated merges, file skipping|


---

### üî• Pro Tip:

If you‚Äôre running frequent incremental updates:

- 	Partition by high-cardinality column that aligns with query filters.
- 	Periodically OPTIMIZE ZORDER on your join key to make merges even faster.
- 	Keep incremental batches reasonably sized (e.g., < few million) for fast commit cycles.


---

üß™ Example End-to-End Incremental Update Job

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

# Incremental source (e.g., new/changed rows)
incremental_df = spark.read.format("parquet").load("/incoming/updates")

# Target delta table
target = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/delta/main_table")

# Merge
(
    target.alias("t")
    .merge(incremental_df.alias("s"), "t.id = s.id")
    .whenMatchedUpdateAll()
    .whenNotMatchedInsertAll()
    .execute()
)
```

üëâ This will update only the relevant subset without reading the entire 80M dataset.


‚úÖ TL;DR

No, you don‚Äôt need to load the full Delta table to update a subset.

Use MERGE INTO or targeted deletes/updates ‚Äî they are designed exactly for this incremental use case.
