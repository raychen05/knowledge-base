- **Reasoning**: The sheer number of open access documents can indicate a high level of transparency and accessibility in research output.

#### 3. **% Gold Documents**
- **Importance**: Measures the proportion of documents published in fully open access journals.
- **Reasoning**: Gold open access is often seen as the most reliable and accessible form of open access, making this an important indicator of commitment to fully open publishing models.

#### 4. **% Gold - Hybrid Documents**
- **Importance**: Shows the proportion of documents published in hybrid journals (subscription-based with the option of open access).
- **Reasoning**: Although hybrid models are common, they indicate partial openness and thus are ranked lower than full Gold open access.

#### 5. **Gold Documents**
- **Importance**: Reflects the number of documents published in fully open access journals.
- **Reasoning**: Absolute numbers of Gold open access publications are important but percentages tend to give a clearer comparative picture.

#### 6. **Gold - Hybrid Documents**
- **Importance**: Reflects the number of documents published in hybrid journals.
- **Reasoning**: Hybrid publications are valued but often considered a less robust form of open access due to the subscription model.

#### 7. **% Green Published Documents**
- **Importance**: Measures the proportion of documents made available through institutional or subject repositories after formal publication.
- **Reasoning**: Green open access is important for researchers in institutions that may not be able to afford Gold open access fees.

#### 8. **Green Published Documents**

- **Reasoning**: While preprints and submitted manuscripts contribute to open access, they are usually less formal and subject to peer review changes.

#### 12. **Green Submitted Documents**
- **Importance**: Reflects the number of submitted manuscripts available.
- **Reasoning**: These are pre-review versions, making them less valued for formal assessment compared to published documents.

#### 13. **% Free to Read Documents**
- **Importance**: Shows the percentage of documents that can be accessed without charge, but are not necessarily fully open access.
- **Reasoning**: Free-to-read models provide access but do not allow reuse rights, so they are less impactful than true open access models.

#### 14. **Free to Read Documents**
- **Importance**: Reflects the number of free-to-read articles.
- **Reasoning**: Accessibility without reuse rights is valuable but considered a less ideal form of open access.

#### 15. **% Green Only Documents**

- **Reasoning**: Lower percentages here are generally seen positively, as they indicate more open access publication.

#### 18. **Non-Open Access Documents**
- **Importance**: Reflects the total number of documents that are behind paywalls.
- **Reasoning**: Non-open access documents are typically ranked lower in assessments focused on openness and accessibility.


 ### Author Position Metrics:


### 1. **% First Author**
- **Importance**: Highly significant in evaluating the contributions of a researcher as the primary author of a work.
- **Reasoning**: In many disciplines, the first author often carries the most responsibility for the research, and this percentage indicates how often an author assumes that role.

### 2. **% Last Author**
- **Importance**: Particularly important in fields like biomedical sciences, where the last author is often the senior researcher or principal investigator.
- **Reasoning**: This metric reflects leadership and mentorship in research, with the last author often overseeing the project.

### 3. **% Corresponding Author**
- **Importance**: Frequently used to determine the role of an author as the primary contact for the research paper.
- **Reasoning**: Being the corresponding author suggests responsibility for communications and overall coordination of the publication, a key leadership role.

### 4. **First Author**
- **Importance**: Indicates the actual count of times an author has been listed as the first author in publications.
- **Reasoning**: This is a straightforward indicator of a researcher’s direct involvement in research contributions, especially in terms of hands-on work and writing.

### 5. **Last Author**
- **Importance**: Reflects the actual count of times a researcher has held the last author position.
- **Reasoning**: While percentages give a more nuanced view, the count of last authorships is still important for reflecting senior roles in research.

### 6. **Corresponding Author**
- **Importance**: Measures the total number of times a researcher has been listed as the corresponding author.
- **Reasoning**: Similar to last author metrics, it shows leadership but without providing a proportional view compared to the total output.


### JCR  Metrics:

#### 1. **Journal Impact Factor (JIF)**
- **Importance**: The most widely recognized and used metric for evaluating the impact of journals.
- **Reasoning**: Reflects the average number of citations received per paper published in a journal during the preceding two years.

#### 2. **5 Year Impact Factor**
- **Importance**: Provides a broader view of a journal’s citation performance over a longer timeframe.
- **Reasoning**: Useful for understanding more established impact trends compared to the 2-year JIF, especially in disciplines with slower citation growth.

#### 3. **Impact Factor w/o Self Cites**
- **Importance**: Adjusted version of the JIF that excludes self-citations.
- **Reasoning**: Helps prevent inflation of citation counts by removing the influence of a journal citing itself.

#### 4. **Eigenfactor**
- **Importance**: Measures the journal's overall influence and importance based on the number of incoming citations, excluding self-citations.
- **Reasoning**: Considers not just the number but also the source of citations, assigning more weight to citations from influential journals.

#### 5. **Article Influence**
- **Importance**: A complementary metric to the Eigenfactor, focusing on the per-article influence.
- **Reasoning**: Indicates the relative importance of articles published in a journal compared to the average across all journals.

- **Reasoning**: Provides an easy-to-understand measure of relative standing.

#### 8. **JIF Quartile**
- **Importance**: Divides journals into quartiles based on their JIF within a specific subject category.
- **Reasoning**: A quick reference for understanding whether a journal is in the top (Q1), middle (Q2), or lower quartiles (Q3, Q4).

#### 9. **JCI Rank**
- **Importance**: Ranks journals within their subject area based on the Journal Citation Indicator (JCI).
- **Reasoning**: Helps to contextualize a journal’s performance within its field.

#### 10. **JCI Percentile**
- **Importance**: Shows the percentile ranking of a journal based on its JCI score.
- **Reasoning**: Provides an easy comparison of a journal’s standing among all journals within its subject category.

#### 11. **JCI Quartile**
- **Importance**: Groups journals into quartiles based on their JCI score, similar to the JIF Quartile.
- **Reasoning**: Useful for categorizing journals by their citation performance over a broader timeframe (3 years).

#### 12. **Journal Citation Indicator (JCI)**
- **Importance**: A normalized metric that accounts for differences in citation practices between disciplines.
- **Reasoning**: Offers a broader view than the JIF, with less susceptibility to short-term citation spikes.

#### 13. **JIF Rank**
- **Importance**: Provides the exact ranking of a journal based on its JIF within a specific category.
- **Reasoning**: Important for granular comparisons within a field, but less informative than quartiles or percentiles.

#### 14. **Immediacy Index**
- **Importance**: Measures how quickly articles in a journal are cited within the first year of publication.
- **Reasoning**: Useful for understanding the short-term impact of a journal but not as comprehensive as longer-term metrics.

#### 15. **Cited Half Life**
- **Importance**: Indicates the median age of articles cited by a journal.
- **Reasoning**: Useful for understanding the longevity of articles, but less commonly used for ranking or evaluation purposes.
