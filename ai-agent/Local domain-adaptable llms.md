## Local, Domain-adaptable LLMs

Great ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially asking about local, domain-adaptable LLMs that can run on-premise (or private cloud) to analyze academic research queries and extract structured entities (research topic, institution, funder, author, journal, country, etc.).

This is a very common requirement in research-tech, where knowledge protection, cost control, and customization are critical. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üîπ Requirements Recap

- Task: Academic entity extraction + intent analysis from natural language queries.
- Constraints: Must run locally (for data privacy & cost savings).
- Adaptability: Should be fine-tunable or at least domain-adaptable to academic corpora.
- Efficiency: Small enough to run on GPUs (or even strong CPUs) without massive infra.

---

### üîπ Recommended Local LLM Options


#### 1. Mistral 7B / Mistral 7B Instruct

- Why:
  - Lightweight, performant, and strong on instruction-following.
  - Can be fine-tuned for entity extraction with LoRA/QLoRA.
- Best for: A balanced model when you want good accuracy + small footprint.
- Hardware: Runs on a single A100 / RTX 4090 with quantization.

---

#### 2. LLaMA 3 (8B or 13B)

- Why:
  - Good general reasoning baseline.
  - Hugely popular ‚Üí ecosystem of adapters, finetunes, and tooling (LangChain, Haystack, etc.).
- Best for: When you want a stable, well-supported open model for further fine-tuning.
- Hardware: 8B can run on a single GPU; 13B better but needs more VRAM.

---

#### 3. Falcon 7B / 40B

- Why:
  - Optimized for efficiency, strong on information extraction.
  - Falcon-7B is very resource-friendly.
- Best for: Resource-limited deployments.

---

#### 4. Domain-Specific Alternatives

- SciBERT (BERT-based)
  - Not a generative LLM but excellent for NER (Named Entity Recognition) in scientific text.
  - Very strong baseline for extracting authors, organizations, topics, journals.
- BioMedLM (Stanford CRFM)
  - If your academic focus leans biomedical/clinical.

---

### üîπ Suggested Architecture

üëâ Instead of relying only on one big local LLM, combine specialized small models + embeddings + retrieval:
1.	Query Understanding Layer
  - Use Mistral 7B Instruct (fine-tuned with LoRA on academic queries) for intent detection (e.g., ‚Äúfind reviewers,‚Äù ‚Äúfunding opportunities,‚Äù ‚Äúresearch trends‚Äù).

2.	Entity Extraction Layer
  - Use SciBERT / fine-tuned BERT NER for high-precision entity tagging:
  - Research topic
  - Organization
  - Funder
  - Author
  - Journal
  - Country

3.	Knowledge Store
  - Store extracted entities in PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch + FAISS for cross-referencing and fast retrieval.


---

### üîπ Advantages of Local Setup

- Data protection ‚Üí sensitive academic queries never leave your infra.
- Fine-tuning ‚Üí you can adapt models to academic ontologies (e.g., Web of Science schema).
- Cost efficiency ‚Üí avoids API costs for high-volume queries.
- Hybrid flexibility ‚Üí fallback to online LLMs (GPT, Claude) only when needed (edge cases).

---

### üîπ Recommendation for You

- Start with Mistral 7B Instruct as the main local LLM.
- Add SciBERT fine-tuned NER for entity extraction accuracy.
- Fine-tune with your academic corpus (grant calls, journal abstracts, author metadata).
- Deploy via vLLM / Ollama / LM Studio for efficient serving.

---

‚ö° This gives you small but accurate, domain-adaptable, and private local NLP pipeline ‚Äî exactly for academic research intent + entity extraction.

Would you like me to sketch a hybrid pipeline diagram (Local LLM + NER model + vector DB) so you can see how this fits into your research assistant system?

##  Hybrid Pipeline Diagram 


Here‚Äôs the hybrid local pipeline diagram:


![alt text](<png/Hybrid Local Academic Query Analysis Pipeline.png>)

- Local LLM (Mistral 7B) handles intent detection (what the researcher wants).
- SciBERT (NER model) extracts entities (topic, organization, funder, author, journal, country).
- Entities flow into a knowledge store (Postgres/Elasticsearch + FAISS).
- Downstream apps like Reviewer Finder, Funding Matcher, Trend Analyzer consume the structured data.

Would you like me to also suggest a training/fine-tuning plan (data sources + methods) to make the LLM + NER layer highly accurate for academic-specific queries?¬†


Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs design a training & fine-tuning plan for your local academic-intent + entity extraction pipeline (LLM + SciBERT/BERT). The goal is to make the system highly accurate for research-specific queries, while keeping it lightweight and private.


---

## üîπ Training / Fine-Tuning Plan


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Sources

You‚Äôll need domain-specific corpora covering research queries, abstracts, and metadata. Recommended sources:

- OpenAlex (papers, authors, journals, institutions) ‚Üí structured metadata.
- MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph, archived but available) ‚Üí large-scale academic entities.
- Crossref / ORCID ‚Üí author + affiliation data.
- arXiv / PubMed abstracts ‚Üí real-world academic text for entity tagging.
- Grants.gov / EU CORDIS datasets ‚Üí funder + grant entities.
- Institution lists ‚Üí canonical university, lab, and country names.

üëâ With these, you can construct training triples:

- Input: natural query (e.g., ‚ÄúFind recent funding in NLP research from NSF authors in Stanford‚Äù)
- Labels:
- Intent ‚Üí Funding Search
- Entities ‚Üí {Topic: NLP, Organization: Stanford, Funder: NSF, Entity Type: Author, Country: USA}

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Local LLM (Mistral / LLaMA) Fine-Tuning

Goal: Specialize the LLM for intent classification + query decomposition.

- Method: LoRA or QLoRA (parameter-efficient finetuning).
- Data: Annotated queries ‚Üí map to intent categories:
- Research discovery
- Reviewer recommendation
- Funding search
- Trend analysis
- Impact analysis
- Outcome: LLM learns to route queries into structured tasks (instead of being a generic chatbot).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ NER Model (SciBERT / Domain BERT) Fine-Tuning

Goal: High-accuracy entity extraction (author, org, funder, country, journal, topic).

- Method: Token classification fine-tuning.
- Data:
- Scientific abstracts with tagged entities (can bootstrap with heuristics using regex + dictionaries).
- ORCID / Crossref metadata aligned with paper titles/abstracts ‚Üí generate entity labels.
- Augmentation: Add synthetic queries generated by LLM (e.g., ‚ÄúWhich journals in Germany are publishing in oncology?‚Äù) with entities auto-labeled from your database.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Knowledge Store Integration

- Normalize extracted entities via:
- Elasticsearch / FAISS for fuzzy author/topic/journal matching.
- Postgres for structured relations (Author ‚Üî Paper ‚Üî Journal ‚Üî Institution ‚Üî Funder).
- Store entity embeddings (e.g., with SPECTER2 for academic papers).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Training Workflow

1.	Phase 1 ‚Äì Train/fine-tune NER model (SciBERT) ‚Üí stable entity extraction.
2.	Phase 2 ‚Äì Fine-tune LLM (Mistral 7B LoRA) ‚Üí intent + query decomposition.
3.	Phase 3 ‚Äì Create pipeline eval set ‚Üí real academic queries ‚Üí check intent + entity F1.
4.	Phase 4 ‚Äì Deploy locally via vLLM / Ollama with both models connected.

---

### üîπ Example Tech Stack

- LLM: Mistral 7B Instruct + LoRA (for intent analysis).
- NER: SciBERT fine-tuned (HuggingFace Transformers).
- Storage: PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch + FAISS.
- Training Infra:
- One A100 (or 2x 3090s) is enough for LoRA + SciBERT fine-tuning.
- Use HuggingFace Trainer for NER.
- Use PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) for LoRA.

---

### üîπ Evaluation Metrics

- NER: Precision / Recall / F1 by entity type (Author, Org, Journal, Funder).
- LLM (intent classification): Accuracy across intent categories.
- Pipeline: End-to-end success rate = ‚ÄúDoes the system extract all needed entities + correct intent for a query?‚Äù

---

‚úÖ This way, you get a compact, private, domain-optimized pipeline that saves cost, protects IP, and is extensible.

---

Would you like me to also draft a sample annotated dataset schema (JSON format) for intent + entities, so you can start collecting/fine-tuning data in a structured way?
