## üîü Major Design Patterns for AI Agents


---

### 1. Tool-Calling Agent

- Pattern: The agent decides when and how to call external APIs/tools (search, DB, calculator, code execution).
- Use cases: Research assistants, customer support bots, finance/data analysis.
- Pros:
  - Extensible with arbitrary tools.
  - Keeps LLM lightweight by delegating work.
- Cons:
  - Needs careful tool selection and schema design.
  - LLM may misuse tools without guardrails.
- Example: LangChain‚Äôs ReAct + Tool calling agents (search ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí answer).


---

### 2. ReAct (Reason + Act) Pattern

- Pattern: Agent interleaves reasoning steps (thoughts) with actions (tool calls).
- Use cases: Question answering with multiple hops, research navigation, code debugging.
- Pros:
  - Transparent decision-making.
  - Strong performance on multi-step tasks.
- Cons:
  - Requires careful prompting (‚Äúchain-of-thought leakage risk‚Äù in deployment).
  - May loop or hallucinate if not bounded.
- Example: ReAct paper (Google/Princeton, 2022) ‚Üí inspired many frameworks like LangChain Agents.


---

### 3. Plan-and-Execute

- Pattern: Agent first generates a plan of steps, then executes them sequentially.
- Use cases: Long workflows (grant matching ‚Üí scoring ‚Üí ranking ‚Üí summarizing).
- Pros:
  - Reduces context switching.
  - More structured than free ReAct loops.
- Cons:
  - Plans may become outdated mid-run.
  - Execution rigidity vs. dynamic adaptation.
- Example: AutoGPT‚Äôs task planner (‚ÄúPlan: search topic, collect 5 papers, summarize ‚Üí Execute steps‚Äù).


---

### 4. Routing / Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Pattern: Dispatcher routes queries to specialized sub-agents (e.g., ‚Äúmath agent,‚Äù ‚Äúlegal agent‚Äù).
- Use cases: Multi-domain copilots, customer support, academic research assistants.
- Pros:
  - Domain experts ‚Üí higher accuracy.
  - Modular, scalable.
- Cons:
  - Requires good intent classification.
  - Routing errors degrade UX.
- Example: OpenAI Assistants API with ‚Äúfunction routing,‚Äù or LangGraph routers.

---

### 5. Reflection / Self-Critique

- Pattern: Agent critiques its own output, revises if low quality.
- Use cases: Writing assistants, code generation, research summarization.
- Pros:
  - Higher reliability.
  - Catches hallucinations/errors.
- Cons:
  - Extra latency + compute cost.
  - May loop in self-critique.
- Example: Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) ‚Üí agent rewrites until satisfied.

---

### 6. Memory-Augmented Agent

- Pattern: Agent uses short-term (scratchpad) + long-term memory (vector DB, graph DB, episodic store).
- Use cases: Personal assistants, research copilots, tutoring systems.
- Pros:
  - Learns user preferences.
  - Enables personalization + continuity.
- Cons:
  - Memory growth = scaling challenges.
  - Forgetting/overwriting needs strategy.
- Example: LangChain‚Äôs memory modules, ChatGPT with custom GPT memory.

---

### 7. Adaptive Retrieval (RAG++)

- Pattern: Agent decides how to retrieve (BM25, dense, hybrid, rerank), reformulates queries, and synthesizes results.
- Use cases: Research paper search, knowledge copilots, compliance/legal assistants.
- Pros:
  - High-quality grounding.
  - Prevents hallucination.
- Cons:
  - Complex orchestration.
  - Retrieval errors ‚Üí bad output.
- Example: Adaptive-RAG with LangGraph (multi-step retrieval and reranking).

---

### 8. Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Pattern: Multiple agents play roles (researcher, critic, summarizer) and collaborate.
- Use cases: Brainstorming, debate systems, peer review automation.
- Pros:
  - Diversity of perspectives.
  - Checks/balances against bias.
- Cons:
  - Orchestration complexity.
  - Higher compute cost.
- Example: ‚ÄúSociety of Mind‚Äù architectures, ChatArena, Microsoft AutoGen framework.

---

### 9. Hierarchical Agent (Manager ‚Üí Worker)

- Pattern: A manager agent delegates subtasks to worker agents, aggregates results.
- Use cases: Enterprise workflows (data pipeline ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí reporting), multi-step research.
- Pros:
  - Clear task decomposition.
  - Parallel execution possible.
- Cons:
  - Manager may fail in decomposition.
  - Workers need specialized prompts.
- Example: BabyAGI (task manager loop), CrewAI multi-agent orchestration.

---

### 10. Guardrail / Safety-Aware Agent

- Pattern: Agent integrates rule-based or ML guardrails (content filters, constraint checkers, verification steps).
- Use cases: Legal compliance, healthcare AI, enterprise copilots.
- Pros:
  - Safer for production.
  - Prevents harmful/incorrect outputs.
- Cons:
  - May over-restrict creativity.
  - Requires ongoing tuning.
- Example: Guardrails.ai, Llama Guard, NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails.
