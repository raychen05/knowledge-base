###  Tests Required During Product Deployment and Release

During product deployment and release, several types of tests ensure that the software is stable, functional, and performs well in the production environment.


#### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing (Before Deployment)

- âœ… Smoke Testing â€“ Ensures the core functionality works after deployment to staging.
- âœ… Sanity Testing â€“ Verifies recent fixes and updates donâ€™t break existing functionality.
- âœ… Regression Testing â€“ Ensures that new changes havenâ€™t introduced new bugs.
- âœ… Performance Testing â€“ Checks system responsiveness, load handling, and stability.
- âœ… Security Testing â€“ Identifies vulnerabilities in the system.
- âœ… User Acceptance Testing (UAT) â€“ Validates if the system meets business requirements.
- âœ… Data Migration Testing (if applicable) â€“ Ensures data integrity after migration.


#### 2. Deployment Testing (During Deployment)

- âœ… Smoke Test on Production â€“ Ensures the application launches and core features work.
- âœ… Configuration Testing â€“ Validates system settings, environment variables, and dependencies.
- âœ… Database Connectivity Test â€“ Ensures that the application connects properly to databases.
- âœ… API and Integration Testing â€“ Checks if external services or microservices communicate correctly.
- âœ… Rollback Testing â€“ Verifies the rollback strategy in case of deployment failure.



#### 3. Post-Deployment Testing (After Deployment)


- âœ… Production Sanity Check â€“ Quick validation of key functionality post-deployment.
- âœ… Monitoring and Log Analysis â€“ Checks system logs for errors, crashes, or performance issues.
- âœ… Real User Testing (RUT) â€“ Observes how real users interact with the deployed system.
- âœ… A/B Testing (if applicable) â€“ Compares user behavior across different versions.


#### 4. Release Testing (Final Validation Before Full Rollout)

- âœ… Canary Testing â€“ Releases the product to a small set of users before full deployment.
- âœ… Blue-Green Deployment Testing â€“ Switches traffic between old and new versions safely.
- âœ… Chaos Testing (Optional) â€“ Tests system resilience by simulating failures.



##### Final Checkpoints for Release:

- âœ” Verify rollback plan in case of issues.
- âœ” Confirm documentation updates (release notes, known issues, etc.).
- âœ” Ensure all monitoring and alerting systems are active.

###  Data Validation Required During Product Deployment and Release

For a weekly baseline data refresh where there is no pipeline logic change, but data comes from various upstream sources, the primary concern is data correctness and data integrity when deploying to production. Below are the essential tests to ensure that the upstream data does not introduce issues.


#### 1. Pre-Deployment Data Validation (Before Loading to Production)

- âœ… Schema Validation â€“ Ensure that the schema (columns, data types, constraints) remains unchanged. (Automated)
- âœ… Data Completeness Check â€“ Verify that expected records are present and none are missing. (Automated)
- âœ… Data Consistency Check â€“ Ensure no duplicate, inconsistent, or conflicting data exists. (Automated)
- âœ… Business Rule Validation â€“ Check if data meets predefined business logic constraints. (Automated)
- âœ… Null/Invalid Value Detection â€“ Identify missing or incorrect values in critical fields. (Automated)


#### 2. Deployment Phase Testing (During Data Deployment)

- âœ… Row Count Matching â€“ Ensure the number of rows in the new data matches expectations. (Automated)
- âœ… Statistical Data Validation â€“ Compare aggregates (sum, avg, min, max) against previous baseline. (Automated)
- âœ… Anomaly Detection â€“ Use machine learning or rule-based approaches to detect unexpected deviations. (Automated)
- âœ… Foreign Key & Referential Integrity Check â€“ Ensure relational constraints are maintained. (Automated)


#### 3. Post-Deployment Data Monitoring (After Data is Live in Production)

- âœ… Data Drift Monitoring â€“ Detect unexpected shifts in data distributions compared to previous weeks. (Automated)
- âœ… Live Query Validation â€“ Run sample queries to check data correctness in production. (Automated/Manual)
- âœ… Downstream Impact Testing â€“ Validate that reports, dashboards, and dependent systems receive expected data. (Automated/Manual)
- âœ… Alerting & Logging â€“ Implement monitoring for data anomalies, missing updates, and schema changes. (Automated)


#### Additional Safeguards

âœ” Backfill Plan â€“ Maintain a rollback plan in case incorrect data is deployed.
âœ” Data Versioning â€“ Keep historical snapshots for comparison and recovery.
âœ” Automated Alerting â€“ Trigger alerts for schema changes, missing data, or data quality degradation.
