## Score aggregation vs. Sorting by script

When dealing with large datasets in Elasticsearch, performance optimization is crucial, especially when dealing with nested fields, sorting, and aggregations like filtering on scores. Here’s a comparison of the nested field with score aggregation vs. sorting by script to help determine which approach is more efficient.

### 1. Nested Fields with Aggregations

**Advantages**:

-	Optimized for Nested Data: Elasticsearch is designed to handle nested fields efficiently, particularly when the data is structured as such. Aggregating and filtering based on nested fields is generally fast if the data is indexed appropriately.
-	Avoids Heavy Computation at Query Time: By using aggregations, especially sum aggregation on the nested fields, the heavy computation is handled by Elasticsearch internally, which is optimized for this kind of task.

**How It Works**:

-	Aggregation Query: Use nested aggregations to filter on the specific topics, aggregate the scores, and sort by the total score.
-	Sorting after Aggregation: The aggregation’s output can then be used to rank results by the summed score.

**Example**:

```json
POST authors_index/_search
{
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "topics",
      "query": {
        "terms": { "topics.topic_name": ["AI", "ML"] }
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "authors_with_total_score": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "topics"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "filtered_topics": {
          "filter": {
            "terms": { "topics.topic_name": ["AI", "ML"] }
          },
          "aggs": {
            "total_score": {
              "sum": {
                "field": "topics.score"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


**Pros**:

-	Built-in Optimizations: Elasticsearch can efficiently handle nested aggregations without excessive computation.
-	Lower Complexity: Elasticsearch can execute the aggregation query with minimal overhead when indexed properly.
-	Efficient for Large Datasets: With proper indexing and filtering, this approach will scale well for large datasets.

*Cons*:

-	Complexity of Setup: Setting up and maintaining nested fields and aggregations requires additional planning, especially when you have a complex structure with many nested items.
-	Overhead in Complex Queries: For very large datasets, if the number of nested elements is high, this approach can still result in higher memory usage.

### 2. Sorting by Script Field (Scripted Sort)

**Advantages**:

-	Custom Sorting Logic: Using scripts allows for custom, flexible sorting logic based on complex computations that aren’t easily handled by standard fields.
-	Dynamic Computation: Allows you to compute the total score dynamically at query time, without needing to store or precompute this in the document.

**How It Works:**

-	Scripted Sort: Compute the sum of the topic scores dynamically at query time and use a script to sort based on the result.
-	Filtering in Query: You can still apply filtering to include only specific topics in the score sum.

**Example**:

```json
POST authors_index/_search
{
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "topics",
      "query": {
        "terms": { "topics.topic_name": ["AI", "ML"] }
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "_script": {
        "type": "number",
        "script": {
          "source": """
            double sum = 0;
            for (t in params['_source']['topics']) {
              if (params.topics.contains(t.topic_name)) {
                sum += t.score;
              }
            }
            return sum;
          """,
          "params": {
            "topics": ["AI", "ML"]
          }
        },
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pros**:

-	Flexible: Can implement any custom sorting logic, not limited to pre-defined aggregations.
-	Dynamic at Query Time: You can calculate and sort based on values that aren’t precomputed.

**Cons**:

-	Performance Overhead: Scripted sorting is computationally expensive because the sorting is done at query time and requires running the script for each result.
-	High Memory Usage: Complex scripts that run for large datasets may cause high memory consumption, especially when the dataset is large.
-	Scalability Issues: As the dataset grows, using scripts for sorting might degrade performance significantly compared to aggregations.

### 3. Comparison of Efficiency

**Nested Aggregations**:

-	Faster for Predefined Sorting: When dealing with large datasets and the need for predefined sorting (like summing up scores), nested aggregations are typically more efficient.
-	Lower Query Time: Elasticsearch has optimizations for handling nested fields and aggregations, especially with large datasets.
-	Better Scalability: Elasticsearch will handle large nested datasets more efficiently by offloading computation to the indexing engine rather than performing expensive scripts at query time.

**Scripted Sorting:**

-	Custom Logic Overhead: While flexible, scripted sorting requires computation at query time, which can become expensive for large datasets.
-	Slower for Large Datasets: When you have a large number of documents, using scripts to sort dynamically can result in high CPU usage and slow response times.
-	Less Efficient for Large Collections: It is not as scalable as aggregation-based queries when the number of documents increases significantly.

### 4. Recommendations for Large Datasets

-	Preferred Approach: Use Nested Aggregations
If you’re working with large datasets and need to sum the scores across topics, nested aggregations with sum aggregation are generally more efficient and scalable.
This approach allows Elasticsearch to process the data in an optimized manner, leveraging its built-in indexing and aggregation capabilities.

-	When to Use Scripted Sort:
Use scripted sort if you have highly dynamic sorting logic that cannot be expressed through aggregations (e.g., complex custom scoring or computations). But be cautious as it may introduce performance bottlenecks.

---

**Conclusion**

-	Nested aggregations are generally more efficient for large datasets and scalable for handling complex queries. They are optimized by Elasticsearch for predefined aggregations and sorting.
-	Scripted sorting offers flexibility but comes with a performance overhead and should be used cautiously with large datasets.

For best results, I recommend starting with nested aggregations and moving to scripted sorting only if the need arises for highly dynamic and custom sorting logic.
