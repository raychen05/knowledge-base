## Funding Opportunities Analysis Agent 


Designing a Funding Opportunities Analysis Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) enables intelligent matching, recommendation, summarization, and trend analysis across a vast and often fragmented funding landscape. The goal is to help researchers, institutions, and innovators find, assess, and strategize around funding opportunities from both public and private sources.

## A Complete example of a Co-PI Graph Schema 


Here’s a complete example of a Co-PI Graph Schema and an Embeddings Setup to support Collaboration Matchmaking and Success Prediction for multi-institution grants.

---

### 🧠 Part 1: Co-PI Collaboration Graph Schema

The collaboration graph models historical co-investigator relationships across funded projects.

📌 Graph Elements

🟦 Nodes

```yaml
Researcher:
  id: researcher_id
  name: full_name
  institution: institution_id
  title: "Professor / Postdoc / PI"
  expertise: ["AI", "Genomics"]
  h_index: int
  publications: int
  grants: [grant_id]
  is_pi_eligible: bool

Institution:
  id: institution_id
  name: "MIT"
  type: "University / Government / Industry"
  country: "USA"
  past_funding: ["NSF", "NIH"]

Grant:
  id: grant_id
  title: "AI for Neurodegenerative Disease"
  agency: "NIH"
  program_type: "R01"
  topic_tags: ["AI", "Healthcare", "Neuroscience"]
  start_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  end_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  funding_amount: $
```

---

🔗 Edges

```yaml
CO_INVESTIGATOR:
  from: researcher_id_1
  to: researcher_id_2
  properties:
    grants: [grant_id_1, grant_id_2]
    strength: float  # #times co-PI or co-authored (normalized)
    last_collaboration_date: YYYY-MM-DD

AFFILIATED_WITH:
  from: researcher_id
  to: institution_id

FUNDED_BY:
  from: grant_id
  to: institution_id / researcher_id
```

---

🔍 Graph Query Example (Neo4j Cypher or NetworkX)


```sql
// Find researchers who co-PI’ed with current PI in the last 5 years
MATCH (pi:Researcher {id: "R123"})-[:CO_INVESTIGATOR]->(r:Researcher)
WHERE r.is_pi_eligible = true AND r <> pi
RETURN r.name, r.institution, r.expertise, r.h_index
ORDER BY r.h_index DESC
```

---

### 🧠 Part 2: Embeddings Setup

Embeddings help measure similarity across researchers, grant descriptions, and topics.

---

✅ Embedding Inputs


| Entity         | Content to Embed                                      | Purpose                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Researcher     | Full bio, publication titles, grant/project abstracts | Match to grant calls           |
| Institution    | Past grant portfolio, research keywords               | Fit & eligibility check        |
| Grant          | Full text of funding call, summary, metadata          | Semantic matching              |
| Role Description | Example: "We need a data scientist with RCT experience" | Role-matching and team search  |


---

⚙️ Embedding Example (HuggingFace)


```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

model = SentenceTransformer("all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Researcher embedding
researcher_bio = "Dr. Alice specializes in clinical AI, wearable devices, and trial design..."
embedding = model.encode(researcher_bio)

# Store in FAISS or Qdrant for similarity search
```


📦 Storage with Metadata (Qdrant Example)

```python
client.upload_collection(
    collection_name="researchers",
    vectors=[embedding],
    payload=[
        {
            "name": "Dr. Alice Tan",
            "institution": "UCLA",
            "expertise": ["clinical trials", "AI", "wearables"],
            "grants": ["R01-XXX", "NSF-YYY"],
            "id": "R456"
        }
    ]
)
```


---

🔁 Combined Matching Pipeline

	1.	User Input: Grant text or role gap (e.g., “Need clinical trial expert in Europe”)
	2.	LLM → extracts role + expertise + eligibility filters
	3.	Vector Search → find top-N matching researchers
	4.	Graph Context → filter by existing co-PI links or institution constraints
	5.	LLM → generate justification:
- 	“Dr. Alice Tan (UCLA) is a strong match. She led 3 NIH trials, co-PI with your PI in 2021, and specializes in the required domain.”

---

📊 Optional Similarity Functions

- 	Embedding cosine similarity
- 	Graph centrality metrics (PageRank, betweenness)
- 	Collaboration recency (filter edge weights)

🧪 Bonus: YAML for a Sample Graph

```yaml
researchers:
  - id: R001
    name: "Dr. Alice Tan"
    institution: INST001
    expertise: ["Clinical Trials", "Wearables"]
    grants: ["G001", "G002"]
    h_index: 45

institutions:
  - id: INST001
    name: "UCLA"
    country: "USA"
    type: "University"

grants:
  - id: G001
    title: "AI for Cardiology"
    agency: "NIH"
    topic_tags: ["AI", "Clinical"]
    funding_amount: 2000000

edges:
  - type: CO_INVESTIGATOR
    from: R001
    to: R002
    strength: 0.9
    grants: ["G001"]
```

##  A Sample Neo4j Graph Gonstructor 

Here is a sample Neo4j graph constructor in Python using the official neo4j Python driver. It defines a Co-PI Collaboration Graph with researchers, institutions, grants, and their relationships.

---

### 🧱 Prerequisites

Install the Neo4j driver


---

### 🧠 Sample Graph Construction Script

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Neo4j connection setup
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
user = "neo4j"
password = "your_password"  # Replace with your real password

driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

# Sample data
researchers = [
    {"id": "R001", "name": "Dr. Alice Tan", "institution": "INST001", "expertise": ["AI", "Clinical Trials"], "h_index": 45},
    {"id": "R002", "name": "Dr. John Kim", "institution": "INST002", "expertise": ["Wearables", "Bioinformatics"], "h_index": 38},
]

institutions = [
    {"id": "INST001", "name": "UCLA", "type": "University", "country": "USA"},
    {"id": "INST002", "name": "MIT", "type": "University", "country": "USA"},
]

grants = [
    {"id": "G001", "title": "AI for Cardiology", "agency": "NIH", "topic_tags": ["AI", "Healthcare"], "funding_amount": 2000000},
]

co_pi_edges = [
    {"from": "R001", "to": "R002", "grants": ["G001"], "strength": 0.9, "last_collaboration_date": "2023-06-15"}
]

# Function to create nodes and edges
def create_graph(tx):
    # Create institutions
    for inst in institutions:
        tx.run(
            """
            MERGE (i:Institution {id: $id})
            SET i.name = $name, i.type = $type, i.country = $country
            """, **inst
        )

    # Create researchers and affiliation
    for res in researchers:
        tx.run(
            """
            MERGE (r:Researcher {id: $id})
            SET r.name = $name, r.h_index = $h_index, r.expertise = $expertise
            """, id=res["id"], name=res["name"], h_index=res["h_index"], expertise=res["expertise"]
        )
        tx.run(
            """
            MATCH (r:Researcher {id: $rid}), (i:Institution {id: $iid})
            MERGE (r)-[:AFFILIATED_WITH]->(i)
            """, rid=res["id"], iid=res["institution"]
        )

    # Create grants
    for g in grants:
        tx.run(
            """
            MERGE (g:Grant {id: $id})
            SET g.title = $title, g.agency = $agency,
                g.topic_tags = $topic_tags, g.funding_amount = $funding_amount
            """, **g
        )

    # Create CO_INVESTIGATOR edges
    for edge in co_pi_edges:
        tx.run(
            """
            MATCH (a:Researcher {id: $from}), (b:Researcher {id: $to})
            MERGE (a)-[r:CO_INVESTIGATOR]->(b)
            SET r.grants = $grants,
                r.strength = $strength,
                r.last_collaboration_date = date($last_collaboration_date)
            """, **edge
        )

# Run transaction
with driver.session() as session:
    session.write_transaction(create_graph)

driver.close()
```

---

### 🔍 After Running the Script

In Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474), you can now explore:

```sql
MATCH (r:Researcher)-[c:CO_INVESTIGATOR]->(r2:Researcher)
RETURN r.name, c, r2.name
```


---

### 🛠 Schema Summary

- 	Nodes:
  - 	(:Researcher {id, name, expertise[], h_index})
  - 	(:Institution {id, name, type, country})
  - 	(:Grant {id, title, agency, topic_tags[], funding_amount})
- 	Edges:
  - 	(:Researcher)-[:CO_INVESTIGATOR {grants[], strength, last_collaboration_date}]->(:Researcher)
  - 	(:Researcher)-[:AFFILIATED_WITH]->(:Institution)
  - 	(optionally) (:Grant)-[:FUNDED_BY]->(:Institution or :Researcher)

---

### 🔄 Optional Enhancements

- 	Add citation count or publication embeddings to researcher
- 	Link :Grant to :Researcher with [:PI_ON] or [:CO_PI_ON]
- 	Run centrality measures to score match influence
- 	Add a recommender function (I can provide one if needed)
