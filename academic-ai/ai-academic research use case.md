‚öôÔ∏è¬†Integration Ideas

-For your LangGraph agent:
    -Each stakeholder ‚Üí a node or persona;
    -Each category ‚Üí subgraph of tasks;
    -Each use case ‚Üí retriever or tool call.
  
-For Streamlit UI:
    -Dropdown filters:¬†stakeholder¬†‚Üí¬†category¬†‚Üí list of actionable tasks.
    -Click on a use case ‚Üí generate LLM plan or workflow.

-For DB or API schema:
    -Store in SQLite or MongoDB under¬†academic_usecases¬†table/collection
    -for easy retrieval by role.


---

‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- Load this JSON into your RAG or LangGraph node to generate workflows or plans.
- Each example_workflow can trigger a tool chain, API pipeline, or retrieval strategy.
- You can extend this easily by adding "tools": ["retriever_faiss", "wos_api", "llm_summarizer"] fields per use case.

### Cross-stakeholder Summary Matrix

![alt text](png/cross-stakeholder.png)

Here‚Äôs the cross-stakeholder summary matrix comparing overlaps and unique focus areas across the eight major academic ecosystem actors.

- ‚úÖ Heatmap above shows shared AI priorities (dark = strong overlap)
- ‚úÖ Table lists where each group is active (1 = relevant, 0 = less relevant)

This matrix lets you quickly see:

- *Shared domains*: ‚ÄúResearch Discovery & Innovation‚Äù and ‚ÄúCollaboration & Networking‚Äù are almost universal.

- *Unique domains*:
  - PhD Students ‚Üí Mentorship & Skill development
  - Funding Agencies & Policy Bodies ‚Üí Grant management & Policy analytics
  - Publishers & Editors ‚Üí Quality assurance focus
  - Industry R&D ‚Üí Strong overlap across innovation and collaboration, weaker on mentorship.

Would you like me to produce a summary report (text + visual) describing:

- common intersections,
- distinctive needs per stakeholder, and
- AI opportunity gaps across the ecosystem?
