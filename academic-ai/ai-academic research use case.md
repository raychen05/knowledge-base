⚙️ Integration Ideas

-For your LangGraph agent:
    -Each stakeholder → a node or persona;
    -Each category → subgraph of tasks;
    -Each use case → retriever or tool call.
  
-For Streamlit UI:
    -Dropdown filters: stakeholder → category → list of actionable tasks.
    -Click on a use case → generate LLM plan or workflow.

-For DB or API schema:
    -Store in SQLite or MongoDB under academic_usecases table/collection
    -for easy retrieval by role.


---

⚙️ Usage

- Load this JSON into your RAG or LangGraph node to generate workflows or plans.
- Each example_workflow can trigger a tool chain, API pipeline, or retrieval strategy.
- You can extend this easily by adding "tools": ["retriever_faiss", "wos_api", "llm_summarizer"] fields per use case.

### A Visual Knowledge Map

Here’s the visual knowledge map showing how the 7 key stakeholder groups interconnect through shared AI use case themes — like innovation, collaboration, policy strategy, and research quality assurance.

### Cross-stakeholder Summary Matrix

![alt text](png/cross-stakeholder.png)

Here’s the cross-stakeholder summary matrix comparing overlaps and unique focus areas across the eight major academic ecosystem actors.

- ✅ Heatmap above shows shared AI priorities (dark = strong overlap)
- ✅ Table lists where each group is active (1 = relevant, 0 = less relevant)

This matrix lets you quickly see:

- *Shared domains*: “Research Discovery & Innovation” and “Collaboration & Networking” are almost universal.

- *Unique domains*:
  - PhD Students → Mentorship & Skill development
  - Funding Agencies & Policy Bodies → Grant management & Policy analytics
  - Publishers & Editors → Quality assurance focus
  - Industry R&D → Strong overlap across innovation and collaboration, weaker on mentorship.

Would you like me to produce a summary report (text + visual) describing:

- common intersections,
- distinctive needs per stakeholder, and
- AI opportunity gaps across the ecosystem?
