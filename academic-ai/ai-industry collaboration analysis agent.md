## Academic–Industry Collaboration Analysis Agent 


Designing an Academic–Industry Collaboration Analysis Agent involves combining structured data (e.g., publications, grants, patents, affiliations, coauthorships, funding sources) with LLM-powered capabilities to interpret, explain, and explore collaboration patterns between academia and industry.

---

📚 8. Document & Project Synthesis

- 	Collaborative Project Summaries: Given a list of joint outputs, generate a natural language summary of the collaboration.
- 	Outcome-Oriented Synthesis: “This university–industry partnership led to… (X papers, Y patents, Z products).”
- 	Proposal Reviewer Assistant: Summarize joint research proposals and detect weak/missing collaboration descriptions.

---

🔎 9. Conversational Analysis Agent

Supports queries like:
- 	“What companies has CMU collaborated with in the past 3 years in robotics?”
- 	“Which collaborations resulted in both publications and patents?”
- 	“Find researchers at Harvard who’ve coauthored with industry on cancer research.”

LLMs can:
- 	Interpret natural language queries
- 	Chain together searches in grant + paper + patent databases
- 	Justify and explain results

---

🧹 10. Metadata Normalization & Entity Linking

- 	Disambiguate Affiliations: Normalize variants like “Google”, “Google LLC”, “Google Research, Mountain View” to canonical entity.
- 	Author–Affiliation Linking Over Time: Track academic–to–industry transitions.
- 	Company Entity Linking: Resolve subsidiaries (e.g., DeepMind → Google).
