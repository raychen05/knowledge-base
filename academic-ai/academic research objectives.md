## Academic Research Objectives

Excellent and high-impact question. You’re asking:

1.	What academic search objectives researchers usually have
2.	What critical information they look for in article results (title, abstract, etc.)
3.	How an AI assistant with LLMs can automate, summarize, categorize, and highlight this information
4.	And how to build an intelligent research search system that goes far beyond keyword or semantic search


Let’s break it down into actionable components with a strong methodology.

### 🎯 Part 1: Researcher Academic Search Objectives

Researchers perform literature search with goals like:

| Objective Type           | Example Queries                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Background learning      | “What are the latest methods in graph neural networks?”               |
| Gap identification       | “What hasn’t been studied in X field?”                               |
| Methodology inspiration  | “How do others approach gene expression clustering?”                  |
| Benchmark comparison     | “Which papers used my dataset/model for comparison?”                  |
| Collaborator discovery   | “Who is publishing in emerging topic Y in the last 2 years?”          |
| Funding alignment        | “What topics match this NSF call?”                                    |
| Innovation detection     | “What’s a novel approach to LLM alignment in biology?”                |

### 📌 Part 2: What Critical Info Researchers Want in Search Results

When scanning search results (titles + abstracts + metadata), researchers want to extract signals like:

| Category         | Signals/Info Extracted                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relevance        | Topic alignment, key terms, research field/domain              |
| Novelty          | New methods, first-of-its-kind claims, unique contributions    |
| Method Used      | Models, algorithms, experimental design/setup                  |
| Datasets/Inputs  | Data sources, dataset names, public/private availability       |
| Results/Outcomes | Metrics (accuracy, AUC, etc.), improvements over baselines     |
| Citations/Repute | Publication venue, citation count, notable authors             |
| Research Type    | Theoretical, empirical, survey, application                    |
| Limitations      | Reported challenges, open questions, suggested future work     |

### 🤖 Part 3: Use AI Agent + LLM to Automate This

🔧 Tools the AI Agent Can Use:

- 	Academic APIs (PubMed, WoS, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, Scopus)
- 	LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- 	Vector search (semantic embedding)
- 	Citation network graphs
- 	Keyword/topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic)

---

### 🧠 Agent Workflow:

#### Step 1: Search + Retrieve Top-N Articles (via topic/keyword/query)
- 	Use vector search, keyword filters, and metadata constraints (date, domain)

#### Step 2: Auto-Summarize Key Elements (LLM)

Prompt
```yaml
Use LLM to extract from title + abstract:

Title: [Title]
Abstract: [Abstract]

Instructions to LLM:
- What is the main research problem?
- What methodology is used?
- What is the novelty?
- What datasets or inputs are used?
- What are the results/outcomes?
- Who might be interested in this paper?

Title: [Title]
Abstract: [Abstract]

Instructions to LLM:
- What is the main research problem?
- What methodology is used?
- What is the novelty?
- What datasets or inputs are used?
- What are the results/outcomes?
- Who might be interested in this paper?
```

---

#### Step 3: Categorize & Tag

- 	Cluster papers into themes: by method, dataset, novelty, application
- 	Tag: survey, benchmark, theoretical, etc.

#### Step 4: Rank or Group Based on User Goal

- 	If goal is “find novel methods”, surface papers tagged “novel” and “new method”
- 	If goal is “survey”, prioritize “review” papers with wide coverage

#### Step 5: Summarize Set + Highlight Insights

- 	Summarize all abstracts into 5–10 sentence digest
- 	Show comparison of methods, datasets, performance if extractable

#### Step 6: Visualize (optional)

- 	Graph of citation network
- 	Timeline of topic evolution
- 	Author/topic co-occurrence map

### 🚀 Efficient Methodology for Intelligent Academic Search System


#### Hybrid Architecture

| Layer                | Component                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Understanding  | Query classification → determine search type (novelty, overview, method match) |
| Retrieval            | Hybrid search: keyword, semantic, and metadata-based filtering |
| Reranking            | LLM-based relevance and novelty scoring/classification         |
| LLM Info Extraction  | Prompt-driven extraction from title and abstract               |
| Categorization       | Clustering via BERTopic or LLM-based tagging                   |
| Synthesis            | LLM-generated summaries per group or topic                     |
| Interaction          | LangGraph agent planner with user feedback and tool orchestration |


#### 💡 Example Prompt for LLM Agent per Abstract

Prompt
```yaml
Extract the following from the abstract below:

1. Main research question or problem
2. Approach/method used
3. Novelty or unique contribution
4. Dataset(s) or experimental setup
5. Key findings or results
6. Type of paper (e.g., survey, theoretical, application)


Abstract:
"...."

#### Bonus: LLM as Comparator

Given two papers:

Paper A: Title + Abstract
Paper B: Title + Abstract

Prompt:
Compare the two papers:
- What problem do they solve?
- How do their methods differ?
- Which is more novel?
- Which has stronger empirical results?
```


#### ✅ Final Output to Researcher

- 	Summarized list with key fields (topic, method, dataset, result, novelty)
- 	Categorized paper groups
- 	1-paragraph summary of top insights
- 	Optional interactive chat: “Why is this paper relevant?” → Agent explains.
