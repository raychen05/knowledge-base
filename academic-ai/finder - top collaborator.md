## Find Top Collaborator 


Here is a detailed, intuitive, and efficient methodology for a new researcher (PhD, postdoc, or professor) to discover the best-fit and most talented research collaborators using Web of Science (WoS) and InCites. This process helps align with funded, emerging, and high-impact topics‚Äîaccelerating both visibility and grant success.


### üéØ Goal:

Identify high-potential research collaborators working on hot, funded, and impactful topics relevant to your next-stage research.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Required:

-	Web of Science Core Collection
-	InCites Benchmarking & Analytics
-	[Optional] Access to WoS API for automation

---

### üîÅ Step-by-Step Methodology



#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Identify Hot, Funded, Impactful Topics

In InCites:

1.	Go to ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù > ‚ÄúResearch Areas‚Äù.
2.	Filter by:
    -	Funding Source (e.g., NSF, NIH, ERC)
    -	Time window (e.g., Last 3‚Äì5 years)
    -	Subject Area (your domain: e.g., AI in Biology)
3.	Sort by:
    -	Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI)
    -	% Funded Publications
    -	Growth in # of publications over time

‚úÖ Output: A shortlist of emerging, high-impact, and well-funded topics.

Example: ‚ÄúDeep learning in drug design‚Äù with CNCI = 3.5 and 70% funded rate since 2021.

‚úÖ Step 2: Get Top Authors Working on These Topics

In Web of Science:

1.	Search using refined topic string:
    -	TS=("deep learning" AND "drug design")
2.	Apply filters:
    -	Year: Recent (e.g., 2020‚Äì2024)
    -	Document Type: Article
    -	Funding Agencies: Top funders (NSF, NIH, ERC, etc.)
3.	Go to ‚ÄúAnalyze Results‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAuthors‚Äù
4.	Export top authors by:
    -	# of publications
    -	# of citations
    -	% funded publications
5.	Also analyze co-authors and institutions.

‚úÖ Output: Ranked list of top productive & visible researchers in your target topic.

Example: Dr. A from MIT, Dr. B from Oxford, Dr. C from ShanghaiTech‚Äîall with >10 publications & high CNCI.

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Analyze Author Influence & Collaboration Network

In InCites:

1.	Go to ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù > ‚ÄúAuthor Search‚Äù
2.	Input shortlisted authors
3.	View:
    -	CNCI, total citations, collaboration score
    -	Frequent collaborators
    -	International collaboration rate
    -	Funding sources tied to each
4.	Map collaboration networks using:
    -	Co-authorship heatmap
    -	Country and institution partnerships

‚úÖ Output: High-impact authors with collaborative behavior aligned to your goals.

Tip: Target authors who are central in networks and have access to strong funders.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Validate Fit and Specialization


1.	For each shortlisted author:
    -	Review their latest 3‚Äì5 papers in Web of Science
    -	Check methods, datasets, and open problems they mention
2.	Identify:
    -	Gaps your expertise can fill
    -	Shared interests in techniques or applications
    -	Funding themes overlap

‚úÖ Output: 3‚Äì5 deeply understood, high-fit potential collaborators.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Prepare for Contact or Collaboration Proposal

Use findings to:
-	Craft personalized emails showing deep knowledge of their work
-	Propose joint grant applications in areas of mutual interest
-	Mention:
-	Shared publication areas
-	Your skills that complement theirs
-	Funding overlap and data from InCites

‚úÖ Output: Higher chance of positive responses from top collaborators

---

### üß† Optional: Automate with API + AI Agent

If you have WoS API access, you can automate:

-	Topic extraction + CNCI scoring
-	Author extraction + impact ranking
-	Institution + co-authorship network building
-	Semantic analysis of abstracts (LLM powered)
