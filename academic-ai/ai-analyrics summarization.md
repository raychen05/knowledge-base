##  Analytics Aummarization Agent


Excellent ‚Äî this is exactly the kind of analytics data where a well-designed LLM summarization prompt can save academic users a huge amount of time.

For datasets like this (where there may be 50+ metrics, but we only want to highlight the most relevant insights), a good summarization strategy should focus on:
1.	Top 10 core insights ‚Äî what academic users most care about.
2.	Additional useful insights ‚Äî secondary but still valuable context.

Below is a recommended structure, followed by a suggested Top 10 +

### ‚úÖ Implementation Tip (Prompt Template)

You can design the LLM prompt like this:

```plaintext
‚ÄúGiven the following analytics table with multiple metric fields, produce a concise but rich summary highlighting:
- 	The top 10 key insights most relevant to academic users (e.g., top ranks, impact metrics, institutions, outliers).
- 	Additional useful observations beyond the top 10.
Focus on clarity, insightfulness, and avoiding listing raw numbers only. Mention names, affiliations, and metric highlights as needed.‚Äù

```


###  Ready-to-use Summarization Prompt 

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-use LLM summarization prompt template you can plug into your pipeline (e.g., after reading CSV ‚Üí converting to structured text or JSON).
It‚Äôs designed to handle variable metric fields, focus on academic analytics, and generate a top 10 + additional insights summary like the one I demonstrated:

üß† üìå LLM Summarization Prompt Template
```plaintext
You are an expert research analytics assistant specializing in academic impact analysis.  
You will receive a CSV table containing analytics data for multiple researchers.  
The columns may vary but typically include researcher identifiers (name, affiliation, IDs) and 50+ possible metrics (e.g., Rank, Times Cited, Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI), Collab-CNCI, % Documents Cited, etc.).

Your task:
1. **Read and analyze the table carefully.**
2. **Summarize the dataset by extracting the Top 10 most important and critical insights** that academic users typically care about, including but not limited to:
   - Top researchers by overall rank or performance
   - Top researchers by Times Cited (total citation impact)
   - Top researchers by CNCI (field-normalized impact)
   - Top researchers by Collab-CNCI (collaborative impact)
   - Top researchers by % Documents Cited (visibility)
   - Institutions with the highest representation among top performers
   - Researchers with exceptionally high CNCI or Collab-CNCI values
   - High productivity researchers by document volume
   - Notable outliers between citation count vs normalized impact
   - Patterns of collaboration or affiliation diversity

3. Then, provide **an ‚ÄúAdditional Useful Insights‚Äù section**, including secondary but valuable information such as:
   - Researchers with high CNCI but low document counts (emerging high-impact researchers)
   - Missing or inconsistent metadata (e.g., missing ORCID)
   - Repeated key affiliations
   - Rank shifts between CNCI vs Times Cited
   - Collaboration trends (e.g., multiple affiliations, cross-institution collaborations)
   - Exceptional % Documents Cited values
   - Institutional or regional clusters

4. Structure your output in two sections:
   - **Top 10 Key Insights:** Use numbered bullet points with clear, insightful, and concise language. Do not simply list raw numbers ‚Äî provide short interpretations (e.g., ‚ÄúResearcher X stands out for having one of the highest CNCI scores despite relatively few documents.‚Äù).
   - **Additional Useful Insights:** Use bullet points.

5. Maintain a **professional, analytical tone** suitable for academic users.  
Avoid generic phrases. Focus on real, data-grounded insights that would help a user quickly understand the most important patterns without reading the full table.

6. If metric fields are missing for some researchers, intelligently ignore or flag them in the summary.

Here is the analytics table:

[Insert CSV content here]
```

### üõ† Optional Pre-processing Tip (before feeding CSV)

If your CSV is large, it‚Äôs often useful to convert it to a compact JSON array of objects with selected key metrics and top N rows (e.g., top 50 by rank) before feeding into the LLM, like:

```json
[
  {
    "Person Name": "Jemal, Ahmedin",
    "Rank": 1,
    "Times Cited": 169880,
    "CNCI": 67.29,
    "Collab-CNCI": 53.92,
    "% Documents Cited": 81.74,
    "Documents": 230,
    "Affiliation": "American Cancer Society"
  },
  ...
]
```

This makes the prompt more efficient and ensures the model focuses on the right signals.


### üß™ Integration Example (Pseudocode)

```python
import pandas as pd
import openai

# Load CSV
df = pd.read_csv("research_analytics.csv")

# (Optional) Sort and select top 50 by Rank
df = df.sort_values(by="Rank").head(50)

# Convert to JSON string
data_json = df.to_json(orient="records")

# Construct prompt
prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.replace("[Insert CSV content here]", data_json)

# Send to LLM
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-5",  # or whichever you're using
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    temperature=0.3,
)

summary = response.choices[0].message["content"]
print(summary)

```


### üìä Output Example (Summary)

```paintext
Top 10 Key Insights:
1. Ahmedin Jemal leads overall (Rank 1) with the highest Times Cited (169,880) and a strong CNCI of 67.29.
2. Rebecca Siegel stands out for her extremely high CNCI (229.07) and Collab-CNCI (185.51), ranking 2nd overall.
3. Mathieu Laversanne achieves the highest CNCI (304.39) and Collab-CNCI (182.48) despite only 31 publications.
...

Additional Useful Insights:

- American Cancer Society and IARC dominate the top ranks, highlighting institutional concentration of impact.
...
```


###  üß† üìå Compressed LLM Summarization Prompt (Pipeline Version)

Here‚Äôs a shorter, compressed version of the summarization prompt ‚Äî ideal for automated pipelines, batch summarization, or low-token environments (e.g., summarizing dozens or hundreds of analytics tables quickly).

This version preserves the analytical depth but uses tight wording and assumes the model already ‚Äúknows‚Äù basic academic analytics concepts:

```plaintext
You are an expert in academic research analytics. 
Analyze the following researcher metrics table and produce a concise summary for academic users.

1. Give the **Top 10 Key Insights** that highlight the most important patterns and individuals, focusing on:
   - Top researchers by rank, citations, CNCI, Collab-CNCI, % cited, and output volume
   - Institutions dominating the top ranks
   - Exceptional performers (e.g., very high CNCI or Collab-CNCI, standout ratios)
   - Notable outliers or contrasts between citation count vs normalized impact
   - Patterns of collaboration or multiple affiliations

2. Provide **Additional Useful Insights** as bullet points, covering:
   - High CNCI with low output (emerging high-impact)
   - Missing metadata (e.g., ORCID)
   - Repeated key affiliations or clusters
   - Rank shifts between metrics
   - Collaboration trends, exceptional % cited, or data anomalies

3. Use a professional, analytical tone. Avoid listing raw numbers only‚Äîadd short interpretive comments. 
4. Do not restate the table. Output two sections:

Top 10 Key Insights:
1. ...
2. ...

Additional Useful Insights:
- ...
- ...

Here is the data:
[Insert JSON or CSV table here]
```


### üöÄ Why This Works Well

- 	It removes the long ‚Äúinstructional‚Äù parts and focuses on what to extract.
- 	Works well with structured JSON input of ~20‚Äì50 rows.
- 	Keeps consistent output structure, which makes it easy to parse or display downstream.
- 	You can feed this into GPT-5 (or similar) with temperature=0.3 for stable summaries.


### üß™ Example Integration Snippet (Python)

```python
import pandas as pd
import openai

df = pd.read_csv("research_analytics.csv")
df = df.sort_values("Rank").head(50)
data_json = df.to_json(orient="records")

prompt = COMPRESSED_PROMPT.replace("[Insert JSON or CSV table here]", data_json)

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    temperature=0.3,
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```

## lightweight LLMs - summarizing analytical metrics


Here are some good options + considerations for lightweight, local, free LLMs that are well-suited for summarizing analytical metric tables (like your researcher analytics data). I‚Äôll include trade-offs (quality vs resource usage) so you can pick what fits your hardware and accuracy needs.


### üîç Key criteria for your use-case

Since your use-case is summarizing metric tables with many fields, you‚Äôll want a model that:
- 	Handles tables / structured input or long context (so you can feed multiple rows).
- 	Has decent instruction-following capability (to follow prompts like ‚Äúextract top 10 insights‚Äù).
- 	Produces coherent summaries, minimal hallucinations.
- 	Is lightweight enough to run locally (likely on CPU or modest GPU) and ideally quantizable.


‚úÖ Good candidate models

Here are models that seem to hit a solid balance. I list approximate parameter size / strength / resource demands, so you can judge.


| Model             | Size / Resource Approximate      | Strengths for Table Summarization / Trade-offs                                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TinyLlama         | ‚âà 1.1B params                    | Extremely lightweight; runs easily on CPU/small GPU (especially quantized). Good for basic extraction and simple summaries. May miss subtle insights or complex reasoning. |
| Gemma 3           | 4B or smaller variants           | Mid-lightweight; 4B version needs more memory but is manageable. Better detail and instruction following than TinyLlama. Quantization (e.g., GGUF/4-bit) recommended.   |
| Mistral           | 7B                               | Higher resource demand; best with GPU or strong CPU/memory. Strong summarization, nuanced reasoning, and top insight extraction.                                      |
| LLaMA 3           | 8B or smaller variants           | Larger; smaller variants can be quantized. Long context windows and good instruction tuning make it strong for summarization if resources allow.                      |
| Phi-3 Mini        | ‚âà 3.8B                           | Balanced option; moderate resource needs, works well quantized. Decent reasoning and prompt-following for more complex summaries.                                     |


### ‚ö† Trade-offs and what to watch out for

- 	Context window size: If your tables are large (many rows, many metrics), you‚Äôll need enough context to include what matters. Smaller models may force you to chunk the input; chunking can loss coherence or comparison ability.
- 	Quantization: Using 4-bit or similar quantization formats can greatly reduce memory/Vram usage, at some loss of fidelity. For summarization it often works okay.
- 	Instruction tuning: Models that are fine-tuned for instructions or summarization tend to perform much better when you ask for ‚Äútop 10 insights, additional useful insights‚Äù etc.
- 	Latency vs quality: Smaller models are faster but may produce less detailed or less accurate outputs. Be prepared to test several with your data.
- 	Evaluation: Establish a small benchmark on your own data (maybe 5-10 tables), compare summaries by different models to see which gives you the ‚Äúmost useful insights‚Äù with minimal manual correction.


### üéØ My recommendation: Best pick for your setup

Given you probably want good quality (not just basic extraction) but also want something local / lightweight, I‚Äôd suggest:

**Gemma 3 (4B variant)** as the best overall tradeoff if you have a modest GPU (or good CPU + memory + quantization).

If your hardware is more limited, start with TinyLlama (1.1B) as a baseline. If needed, move up to something like Phi-3 Mini or Mistral 7B.

## Practical Hardware Guideline  - Gemma 3 (4B variant) 


Great ‚Äî Gemma 3 (4B) is a very solid choice for analytical data summarization:
- 	It‚Äôs much more capable than 1‚Äì2 B models for reasoning across multiple metrics,
- 	But still light enough to run locally on a mid-range workstation or server,
- 	And it can handle structured table inputs well if prompt-engineered correctly.

Below is a practical hardware guideline for running Gemma 3 (4B) locally to do real-time summarization of analytical metric data (e.g., your researcher tables) with parallel request handling üëá


### üß† 1. Model Reference

- 	**Model**: Gemma 3 (4B) ‚Äî Instruction-tuned variant
- 	**Quantization**: GGUF (e.g., Q4_K_M or Q4_K_S)
- 	**Framework**: llama.cpp, llama-cpp-python, or Ollama for easy local serving
- 	**Context Window**: Typically 4k‚Äì8k tokens (sufficient for 20‚Äì50 rows of structured JSON)


### üñ• 2. Minimum Hardware (for single requests, real-time)



| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU**   | 8+ cores (modern x86_64, e.g., AMD Ryzen 7 / Intel i7 10th gen or later) | ‚Äî |
| **RAM**   | 16 GB (bare minimum) | 24‚Äì32 GB preferred for stability |
| **GPU**   | Optional | 6‚Äì8 GB VRAM (if available, can significantly accelerate inference) |
| **Disk**  | SSD, ~10‚Äì20 GB free space for model + cache | ‚Äî |
| **OS**    | Linux or macOS preferred | Windows also works via llama.cpp/Ollama |

üëâ With this spec, you can comfortably run Gemma 3 (4B) in Q4 quantization and handle one summarization request in ~0.5‚Äì1.5 s latency.


### üöÄ 3. Recommended Hardware (for parallel real-time summarization)

If you want to handle multiple parallel summarization requests (e.g., from different users or batch jobs) with low latency, aim for:


| Component   | Recommended for Production                                                                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU**     | 16‚Äì32 cores (e.g., AMD Ryzen 9, Threadripper, Xeon)                                                         |
| **RAM**     | 32‚Äì64 GB                                                                                                    |
| **GPU**     | Strongly recommended. NVIDIA RTX 4070/4080/4090 or A100; 8‚Äì16 GB VRAM enables 2‚Äì8 concurrent inference jobs. |
| **Disk**    | NVMe SSD (for fast model loading and caching)                                                               |
| **Networking** | 1 Gbps+ if serving over LAN/intranet                                                                     |

üëâ With this setup, you can:
- 	Run the model in GPU mode (llama.cpp with --gpu-layers),
- 	Host it behind a local REST API using Ollama or llama-cpp-python,
- 	Parallelize 4‚Äì8 summarization requests concurrently with latency still < 1 s per request.


### üß∞ 4. Suggested Software Stack

For stable, scalable local deployment:

- 	Ollama (easiest)
  - 	ollama pull gemma:4b-instruct
  - 	Run as a local service, then call via HTTP.
  - 	Good for parallel workloads and managing multiple models.
- 	llama-cpp-python (fine control)
  - 	Install with GPU support (pip install llama-cpp-python --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu121)
  - 	Serve with FastAPI or Flask for multi-threaded inference.
- 	Quantization: Use Q4_K_M or Q4_K_S for good quality-speed balance.

Q3 or Q2 can run on even lower spec but with noticeable quality drop.



### üåê 5. Example Real-Time Inference Server (Python + FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Load Gemma 3 4B Q4 quantized model
llm = Llama(model_path="gemma-3-4b-q4_k_m.gguf", n_ctx=4096, n_threads=8, n_gpu_layers=35)

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/summarize")
async def summarize(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    table_json = data["table"]

    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert analytics assistant. Summarize the following table...
    [Insert compressed summarization prompt here]
    {table_json}
    """

    output = llm(prompt, max_tokens=800, stop=["</s>"])
    return {"summary": output["choices"][0]["text"].strip()}
```

    üëâ Run with uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4 for parallel requests.


###  ‚ö° 6. Performance Notes

- 	Latency per request:
  - 	CPU only: 1‚Äì2 s per summarization (small tables).
  - 	GPU (RTX 4070+): typically < 0.7 s.
- 	Parallel handling:
  - 	With 16 CPU cores, 4 workers, and Q4 quantization, you can serve ~8‚Äì12 concurrent summarizations with moderate latency.
  - 	With GPU, throughput increases significantly (20+ RPS possible depending on prompt size).
- 	Warm Start: Keep the model loaded persistently. First load is slower (~20 s).



### üìù TL;DR: Recommended Baseline Production Spec

‚úÖ For reliable real-time, parallel summarization with Gemma 3 (4B)
- 	CPU: 16+ cores
- 	RAM: 32 GB
- 	GPU: 8‚Äì12 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 4070)
- 	Storage: NVMe SSD
- 	Quantization: Q4_K_M
- 	Framework: Ollama or llama-cpp-python + FastAPI

üëâ This will give you production-quality summarization of analytics tables in real time, fully offline, free, and local.
