## Prompt - Innovation Idea for Academic Agent


Provide the realistic implementation including  required component: llm prompt,  rag search,  ai approach,  input data and output, ui design for the feature: 


Here are innovative, LLM-powered features + UI ideas for your academic paper search platform, designed to go beyond keyword search and transform how users understand, explore, and trust research:

---

🔍 1. Ask Me Anything (AMA) over Paper

- 	Feature: Chat-style Q&A interface that lets users ask natural language questions like:
- 	“What’s the main contribution of this paper?”
- 	“What dataset and model did they use?”
- 	“Any limitations or biases mentioned?”
- 	LLM Role: Semantic parsing + answer synthesis from fulltext or sections (e.g., methods, results)
- 	UI:
- 	Floating chat widget alongside the paper viewer
- 	Highlight source text on hover

---

🧭 2. Paper-to-Paper Trail (Causal Citation Map)

- 	Feature: Visual + textual path showing how one idea evolved across multiple papers
- 	From foundational → applied → state-of-the-art → critique papers
- 	LLM Role: Cluster and explain how each citing paper builds/refutes previous work
- 	UI:
- 	Horizontal timeline or Sankey graph
- 	Click to expand mini-summaries for each link

---

📑 3. Reading Path Recommender (Beginner to Expert)

- 	Feature: Auto-generated learning path for any topic
- 	Starts with intro/tutorial papers → surveys → foundational → advanced
- 	LLM Role: Categorize papers by difficulty & type (tutorial, review, experiment)
- 	UI:
- 	Collapsible card layout by level
- 	“Mark as read” progress tracker

---

🧠 4. “What’s New?” Innovation Score

- 	Feature: LLM compares a paper with its cited works to identify:
- 	New methods, datasets, ideas not found in predecessors
- 	LLM Role: Contrastive summarization between target and references
- 	UI:
- 	“Innovation Highlights” badge on paper cards
- 	Tooltip breakdown (e.g., “Introduced X for the first time…”)

---

⚖️ 5. Critique Mode (Reviewer Lens)

- 	Feature: Let users toggle “reviewer mode” to see:
- 	Method weaknesses, reproducibility concerns, dataset bias, etc.
- 	LLM Role: Structured critique from methods/results
- 	UI:
- 	Inline annotations (e.g., ⚠️ flag on vague metrics)
- 	Panel of scores (e.g., novelty, rigor, reproducibility)

---

📊 6. Citation Forecasting

- 	Feature: Predict a paper’s future citation trend
- 	LLM Role: Time-series modeling + textual signals (e.g., news, social media, grant alignment)
- 	UI:
- 	Sparkline next to citation count
- 	“Expected to gain traction in X subfield”

---

🧬 7. Topic Evolution Timeline (Author / Field)

- 	Feature: Visualizes how an author’s or topic’s focus evolved over time
- 	LLM Role: Topic modeling + cluster labeling
- 	UI:
- 	Interactive timeline with color-coded research areas
- 	Click to zoom into papers per year

---

📌 8. Paper Summarizer + Mind Map Generator

- 	Feature: Auto-generate a mind map from a paper’s abstract/methods/results
- 	LLM Role: Section-based summarization + semantic clustering
- 	UI:
- 	Graph view of nodes: Problem → Method → Results → Implications
- 	Export to PDF/Notion

---

🕵️ 9. Controversy Detector / Debates Panel

- 	Feature: Shows conflicting citations or criticisms
- 	LLM Role: Analyze citing papers and peer reviews (PubPeer, Scite)
- 	UI:
- 	“This claim is debated by 3 papers” expandable card
- 	Pro/Con split view

---

🧾 10. Funding & Impact Tracker

- 	Feature: Shows grants/funding linked to the paper + broader policy or tech impact
- 	LLM Role: Link paper to funders, patents, standards, government reports
- 	UI:
- 	“Funded by NIH, Horizon Europe”
- 	“Cited in FDA guidance”
