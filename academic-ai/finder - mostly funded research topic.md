## Find Emerging & Mostly Funded Research Topic


Here’s a detailed, intuitive, and efficient methodology a new researcher (PhD or professor) can follow using Web of Science (WoS) and InCites to discover hot, emerging, and well-funded research topics that are likely to lead to impactful work and funding opportunities.

---

### 🎯 Goal:

Identify research topics that are:

-	Recently emerging and trending
-	Heavily funded
-	High in research impact
-	Aligned with the researcher’s field or strength
-	With gaps/opportunities for novel contributions

---

### 🛠️ Tools:

-	Web of Science
-	InCites Benchmarking & Analytics
-	Optional: Funding agencies’ public databases (e.g., NSF, NIH, EU CORDIS)
-	Export to tools like Excel or bibliometric software (e.g., VOSviewer) for clustering

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Approach

---

#### ✅ Step 1: Identify Your Field’s Macro Landscape

Tool: Web of Science → “Basic Search”

Actions:

1.	Go to Web of Science → Use “Topic” search:
    -	E.g., "artificial intelligence" OR "machine learning"
    -	Refine by year range (last 3–5 years)
2.	Use Filters:
    -	Document type: Articles, Reviews
    -	Funding Agency (important for later)
    -	Categories: Refine by WoS subject category (e.g., “Engineering, Biomedical”, “Computer Science”)

Outcome:
-	You now have a corpus of recent articles from your field.

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Use Citation Trend to Spot Emerging Areas

Tool: Web of Science → “Analyze Results”

Actions:

1.	Click “Analyze Results”
2.	Analyze by:
    -	Publication Year → shows trends over time
    -	Funding Agencies → see which funders are active
    -	Research Areas or Keywords → see which subtopics are growing
3.	Note which topics/keywords have sharp increases in publication over last 1–2 years

Optional:
-	Use “Citation Report” to identify which papers are most cited recently, not historically
-	Export data and plot if needed

Outcome:
-	List of rapid-growth topics and high-impact articles in the last 2–3 years

---


#### ✅ Step 3: Move to InCites – Benchmark Hot Topics

Tool: InCites → “Analyze” tab

Actions:

1.	In InCites, create a Research Area by:
    -	Keywords from Step 2 (e.g., “explainable AI”, “gene editing”, “graph neural networks”)
2.	Filter:
    -	Year: last 1–3 years
    -	Document type: Articles, Reviews
    -	Field-normalized citation impact (FNCI) > 1.5
3.	Explore:
    -	Collaboration networks (international, institutional)
    -	Top funders by topic
    -	Top institutions & researchers

Outcome:
-	Benchmark which topics have above-average impact, top funders, and active players

---

#### ✅ Step 4: Extract Funding Data

Tool: InCites → Filters → “Funding Agency” + “Funding Text”

Actions:

1.	Identify which agencies are most active funders for the selected high-impact topics
2.	Note:
    -	Country
    -	Amount (if listed)
    -	Common keywords in funded projects

Outcome:
-	You now have insight into which agencies are investing in each hot topic

---

#### ✅ Step 5: Identify Gaps and Opportunities


Cross-analyze in InCites or WoS:

-	Are there high-impact topics with fewer publications? (less competition)
-	Are there emerging intersections (e.g., “AI + Neuroscience”, “Blockchain + Supply Chain”)?

---

#### ✅ Step 6: Validate with High-Citation and Funded Articles

Tool: Web of Science

Actions:

1.	From selected topics, go back to WoS and:
    -	Sort articles by recent citations
    -	Filter for articles with funding acknowledgement
2.	Read abstracts/intros of top articles to:
    -	Understand current focus areas
    -	Identify open problems or future work

### 📌 Summary of Key Indicators to Track


| Signal                        | Why It’s Important                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 📈 Rising publications        | Indicates the topic is growing and timely   |
| 💰 Active funding             | Shows agencies are investing in this area   |
| 🔥 High citation impact       | Reflects that research is gaining traction  |
| 🤝 Collaborative networks     | Suggests strong momentum and connections    |
| 🔍 Fewer players (low saturation) | Higher chance to stand out and contribute uniquely |




### 🧪 Optional Tools for Visualization


-	VOSviewer: Load WoS export and visualize keyword clusters
-	Bibliometrix (R package): For science mapping
-	PowerBI/Tableau: Custom dashboards with InCites export

---

### 🧠 Final Advice

-	Focus on emerging subfields with:
-	Recent funding spikes
-	Growing publication and citation curves
-	Fewer dominant players
-	Align your research strengths + curiosity with a high-impact niche
-	Consider collaboration with institutions already receiving grants in that space
