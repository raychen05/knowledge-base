## Ranking paper & author


Here‚Äôs a comprehensive methodology to rank academic papers and identify leading researchers for a given topic/keyword search ‚Äî combining retrieval, scoring, and ranking based on relevance, quality, impact, and novelty:


---

### üîç Part 1: Ranking Academic Papers by Quality, Impact, and Novelty


‚úÖ Step 1: Initial Retrieval

Use a hybrid search:
-	BM25 or keyword match: For precise relevance.
-	Dense vector search (e.g., SPECTER, SciBERT): For semantic similarity.
-	Combine scores: FinalScore = Œ± * BM25 + Œ≤ * EmbeddingSim

‚úÖ Step 2: Relevance Filtering

Apply NLP to match:
-	Title + Abstract with user query intent.
-	Optional: Use query classification or topic modeling to match subfields or narrow scope.

‚úÖ Step 3: Ranking by Impact, Quality, and Novelty


 üß† Features to Score Papers:

| Feature Category | Metrics                                                                 | How to Compute                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact           | Total citations (age-normalized), field percentile, journal impact factor| APIs: Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, Semantic Scholar  |
| Quality          | Venue tier, author H-index, venue retraction rate                       | Databases: CORE, Scopus                                     |
| Novelty          | NLP-based novelty score, low literature overlap, unique contributions   | Cosine similarity with prior works, LLM extraction          |
| Recency          | Publication year, citation acceleration                                | Metadata: publication date, citation trends                 |
| Centrality       | Citation network centrality (PageRank, betweenness)                    | Build citation graph (OpenAlex, WoS)                        |
| Altmetrics       | Social media, blog, policy mentions (optional)                         | Altmetric API                                               |


‚úÖ Step 4: Novelty Scoring Methods

Use LLM or fine-tuned models to extract and compare:
-	Contribution sentences (from abstract or full text)
-	Compute similarity with existing works from last N years
-	Score = 1 - average similarity to prior works

Or use a trained classifier for:
-	Novelty prediction (e.g., using SciBERT embeddings + novelty labels from datasets like SciFact or ACL-NLP).

‚úÖ Step 5: Final Scoring Function (Weighted Rank)


```plaintxt
FinalScore = 
    0.35 * RelevanceScore +
    0.25 * ImpactScore +
    0.15 * NoveltyScore +
    0.10 * QualityScore +
    0.10 * RecencyScore +
    0.05 * CentralityScore
```

Weights can be user-tunable or optimized via supervised learning.

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Part 2: Identifying Leading Researchers on a Topic



‚úÖ Step 1: Candidate Researcher Extraction

From the top-N most relevant papers:
-	Extract all authors (first, last, corresponding).


‚úÖ Step 2: Aggregate Author Statistics


| Metric         | Description                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic Relevance| Number of topic-matched papers                                   |
| Impact         | Sum of citations, h-index, or i10-index within the topic         |
| Recency        | Research activity in the last 3‚Äì5 years                         |
| Authority      | Author‚Äôs centrality in the topic-specific citation network       |
| Collaboration  | Degree of international or interdisciplinary collaborations      |
| Influence      | Number of times cited by others within the topic citation graph  |


Use author disambiguation (via ORCID, or clustering via name + affiliation + coauthors).

‚úÖ Step 3: Researcher Scoring Function

```plaintext
AuthorScore = 
    0.4 * TopicImpactScore + 
    0.2 * TopicRelevance + 
    0.15 * RecencyScore + 
    0.15 * CitationCentrality + 
    0.1 * CrossCollabScore
```


Optional: Rank by leadership role (first/corresponding authorship, PI status).
