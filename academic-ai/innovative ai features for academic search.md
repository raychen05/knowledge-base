### 🔐 Licensing & Compliance Considerations


| Consideration                | Notes                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WoS/InCites API use          | Requires a commercial license for data access and any downstream reuse or redistribution. |
| LLM API usage (GPT-4, Claude)| Ensure compliance with data privacy policies; manage API rate limits and associated costs. |
| Embedding models             | Open-source models like SPECTER and BGE can be used for local processing.              |
| Data sharing                 | Only share derived or aggregated data publicly unless explicit permission is granted.   |
