##  Academic Search UI Redesign


Here’s an innovative redesign concept for an LLM-powered academic search UI, replacing the traditional "list + sidebar filters" interface with a multi-pane, interactive, insight-rich, agent-driven experience. This focuses on explainability, summarization, context, and actions, not just metadata display.


### 🔍 Redesigned Academic Search UI (LLM-Powered)

🖼️ Layout Overview (4 Main Panels)

| Pane                           | Function                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔤 A. Semantic Query Panel      | Show interpreted intent, filters, and reformulated queries                        |
| 📊 B. Insight Summary Panel     | LLM-generated summary of themes, methods, findings, and clusters                  |
| 📚 C. Smart Result Explorer    | Interactive, tag-rich paper cards with citation insights and quick actions         |
| 🧠 D. Context & Tools Side Panel | Co-pilot assistant, topic map, paper compare, author insights                     |

### 🧪 Example Use Case

User Query: “Latest in GANs for histopathology images”

UI Delivers:
- ✍️ LLM summary: “Most papers use CycleGAN for stain normalization. Accuracy improves ~8% in classification tasks. TCGA is the dominant dataset.”
- 📚 Paper list sorted by novelty
- 🔍 Explain “Why this paper?” (LLM reasoning)
- 📈 Cluster: Data Augmentation / Normalization / Generation
- 🧠 ChatGPT-style assistant: “Show only papers validated across 3 datasets”

Here are 5 advanced AI features from leading academic platforms (like Semantic Scholar, Scopus, Dimensions, Meta AI, and ResearchRabbit) not yet included in your current UI design, but worth considering for innovation:

## 🔝 Top 5 AI Features to Add:


### 1. Citation Context + Influence Scoring
   
Platforms: Semantic Scholar, Scite.ai 

What it does:
- Shows how a paper is cited (supportive, contrasting, background)
- Uses NLP to extract the citation context from citing papers
- Highlights influential citations rather than raw counts

Why it’s powerful: 
- Better than raw citation numbers; shows actual research impact and how work is used.

### 2. Author Topic Evolution Timeline

Platforms: Scopus, ResearchRabbit 

What it does:
- Visualizes how an author’s research interests have shifted over time
- Detects emerging areas or topic pivots
- Embedding-based author profiling

Why it’s powerful: 
- Great for understanding research trajectories and identifying future collaborations.

### 3. Full-Text Concept Extraction + Claim Mining

Platforms: Meta (by Chan Zuckerberg), Dimensions AI 

What it does:
- Extracts scientific claims, methods, and evidence from full text (not just abstract)
- Tags key results, population, intervention, outcome (for clinical/biomedical fields)

Why it’s powerful: 
- Unlocks much deeper semantic understanding—ideal for building structured knowledge graphs.

### 4. FAI-Powered Research Feed / Discovery Engine

Platforms: ResearchRabbit, Connected Papers 

What it does:
- Learns from your interactions to suggest relevant, novel papers
- Builds dynamic research trees and visual citation graphs
- “Spotify for research” style personalized exploration

Why it’s powerful: 
- Serendipitous discovery and literature mapping based on user behavior and embeddings.

### 5. FRetraction + Quality Signal Detection

Platforms: Scite, PubPeer (integrated), Semantic Scholar (early warning flags) 

What it does:
- Flags retracted, controversial, or low-quality papers using NLP, citations, and peer comments
- Adds trustworthiness signals to paper display

Why it’s powerful: 
- Protects users from citing invalid research and improves scientific integrity.

```python

import streamlit as st
from components.semantic_query import render_query_panel
from components.insight_summary import render_insights
from components.result_explorer import render_results
from components.context_tools import render_tools

st.set_page_config(layout="wide")
st.markdown("<h1>🔍 Academic Search Assistant</h1>", unsafe_allow_html=True)

# Layout into 2 rows
col1, col2 = st.columns([1, 2])
with col1:
    query = render_query_panel()

with col2:
    render_insights(query)

st.markdown("---")

# Result Explorer
render_results(query)

# Contextual Tools
render_tools(query)
```

###✅ 3. semantic_query.py

```python

import streamlit as st

def render_query_panel():
    st.subheader("A. Semantic Query")
    query = st.text_input("Your research query", "deep learning in pathology images")
    
    st.markdown("**Smart Filters**")
    st.checkbox("Topic Clusters")
    st.checkbox("Novelty Score")
    st.checkbox("Influential Citations")

    st.markdown("**Query Interpretation**")
    st.code("→ computer vision, CNNs, cancer classification")

    return query
```


###✅ 4. insight_summary.py

```python

import streamlit as st

def render_insights(query):
    st.subheader("B. Insight Summary")
    st.markdown("> GANs are increasingly used for data augmentation...")
    st.markdown("**Key Findings:**")
    st.markdown("- Top methods: CycleGAN, StyleGAN")
    st.markdown("- Common datasets: TCGA, Camelyon16")

    st.markdown("**Citation Trends**")
    st.line_chart({"2021": 12, "2022": 24, "2023": 58})
```


###✅ 5. result_explorer.py

```python

import streamlit as st

def render_results(query):
    st.subheader("C. Smart Result Explorer")

    for i in range(2):  # mock two results
        with st.expander(f"📄 Paper Title {i+1}"):
            st.markdown("**Highlights**: Proposed new loss function for segmentation")
            st.markdown("- Citation Context: _Supportive_")
            st.markdown("- Retraction Flag: ❌ No")
            st.markdown("- Scientific Claims: 'Improved accuracy by 8%'")

            st.button("💬 Ask AI to Summarize", key=f"sum_{i}")
            st.button("📊 Compare with another", key=f"cmp_{i}")
```

### ✅ 6. context_tools.py

```python

import streamlit as st

def render_tools(query):
    st.subheader("D. Context & Tools")

    with st.expander("🤖 CoPilot Assistant"):
        st.markdown("Ask: 'Summarize GAN classifiers in pathology'")

    with st.expander("🧠 Author Intelligence"):
        st.markdown("Top Author: Dr. J. Smith\n- Topic: Vision\n- Shifted to GANs in 2021")

    with st.expander("🕸️ Topic Map"):
        st.image("data/topic_map_example.png")  # optional image

    with st.expander("⚠️ Retraction Watch"):
        st.markdown("- Paper X was flagged in 2023 (plagiarism)")
```


### ✅ 7. LLM + Data Integration Hooks (in llm_helpers.py, citation_utils.py)

You would:
- Use OpenAI or HuggingFace LLMs for:
    - Query rewriting
    - Summary generation
    - Claim extraction
    - Citation classification (support vs. contrast)
- Use SciBERT or SPECTER embeddings for author/topic clustering

### ✅ Example Sample Paper JSON

```json

{
  "title": "A novel GAN for pathology segmentation",
  "authors": ["Jane Doe", "John Smith"],
  "abstract": "We propose a GAN...",
  "claims": ["Improves segmentation by 8%", "Outperforms UNet"],
  "citation_contexts": [
    {"type": "supporting", "text": "This method builds on Doe et al..."},
    {"type": "background", "text": "GANs have been widely used in..."}
  ],
  "retracted": false
}

```
