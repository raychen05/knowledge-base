### Find Top Reference Articles

Here is a detailed, intuitive, and efficient methodology for a researcher (PhD, postdoc, or professor) to use Web of Science (WoS) and InCites to find the top reference articles on their topic ‚Äî especially those that are impactful, recent, funded, and aligned with current high-visibility research directions.


### üéØ Goal:

Build a targeted, high-impact reference library of articles for your research topic ‚Äî ensuring your work is well-grounded, fundable, and relevant.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Required:

-	Web of Science Core Collection
-	InCites Benchmarking & Analytics
-	(Optional) Web of Science API or EndNote for citation management

---

### üîÅ Step-by-Step Methodology

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define & Refine Your Research Topic

1.	Start with a precise topic phrase or research question.
    -	Examples:
    -	‚Äúdeep learning for drug repurposing‚Äù
    -	‚ÄúCRISPR off-target prediction‚Äù
    -	‚ÄúGraph neural networks in materials science‚Äù

2.	Use Boolean search strings to refine your topic.
    -	TS=("graph neural networks" AND "materials science")

3.	Optionally include:
    -	AND "funding text":("NIH" OR "NSF")
    -	Time window: 2020‚Äìpresent

‚úÖ Output: Well-scoped WoS search for your research area.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Find Top-Cited & Most Impactful Articles

In Web of Science:

1.	Go to Advanced Search or Core Collection
2.	Input your search query
3.	Apply filters:
    -	Publication Years: Last 3‚Äì5 years
    -	Document Type: ‚ÄúArticle‚Äù
    -	Language: English
    -	Open Access (optional)
4.	Sort results by:
    -	Citations (Highest First)
    -	OR Usage Count (Last 180 Days)
5.	Use ‚ÄúAnalyze Results‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFunding Agency‚Äù to confirm funding source alignment

‚úÖ Output: Top-cited and highly used reference articles in your area.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Benchmark Articles Against Global Impact (InCites)

In InCites:

1.	Go to ‚ÄúResearch Areas‚Äù ‚Üí Search or Filter by Your Topic
2.	Click ‚ÄúView Articles‚Äù ‚Üí Export relevant DOIs
3.	Paste those DOIs into:
    -	‚ÄúCompare ‚Üí Documents‚Äù panel in InCites
4.	Review:
    -	Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI)
    -	% of articles in top 10% globally
    -	% Funded Articles
    -	Institution or country benchmarks

‚úÖ Output: Evidence that these articles are highly cited within their field, not just globally.

Pro Tip: Use CNCI > 2.0 and top 10% percentile metrics as thresholds.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Map Reference Graph Around Top Articles

In Web of Science:

1.	Pick top articles and open their full record
2.	Click:
    -	‚ÄúCited References‚Äù ‚Üí See what they cited
    -	‚ÄúTimes Cited‚Äù ‚Üí See who cited them
3.	Export:
    -	Articles that are frequently co-cited
    -	Articles that are building on top of key papers
4.	Use ‚ÄúRelated Records‚Äù feature:
    -	Finds articles that share many references


‚úÖ Output: A citation-centered core literature set with upward and downward relevance.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Prioritize & Organize Final Reference List

Create a prioritized reference list using these ranking criteria:

| Metric           | Source   | Why It Matters                    |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Citations        | WoS      | Basic popularity/authority        |
| CNCI             | InCites  | Impact normalized to field        |
| Top 10% Output   | InCites  | Global visibility                 |
| Funded           | WoS      | Aligns with fundable direction    |
| Recency          | WoS      | Avoids obsolete data              |
| Co-Citation      | WoS      | Structural relevance              |


‚úÖ Final Output: A curated list of 20‚Äì50 foundational + cutting-edge articles.

---

### üì¶ Optional Automation (Advanced)

If you have WoS API access, you can:

-	Programmatically extract articles by topic + filter by citations, funding, CNCI
-	Cluster co-cited papers
-	Use an LLM agent to summarize & group articles by method, application, dataset, etc.

Let me know if you want a LangChain starter or script to automate this.
