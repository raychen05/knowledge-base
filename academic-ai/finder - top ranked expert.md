### 🧪 Step-by-Step Methodology


#### 🔹 Step 1: Define the Research Topic Accurately

-	Use precise keywords, synonyms, and related terms:
-	E.g. for “AI in drug discovery”:
"artificial intelligence" AND "drug discovery"
-	"machine learning" AND "pharmaceuticals"
-	Include Boolean operators: AND, OR, " " (phrase match)

✅ Tip: Start broad, then narrow.

---


#### 🔹 Step 2: Search in Web of Science

Navigate to Web of Science (WoS):
-	Use Advanced Search (for finer filtering):

TS=("artificial intelligence" AND "drug discovery")  

Apply Filters:
-	Document type: Article or Review
-	Timespan: Last 5 or 10 years
-	Subject categories (if needed)

Export Metadata:
-	Export top 500–1000 articles with fields:
Author, Title, Abstract, Affiliations, Times Cited

---


#### 🔹 Step 3: Identify Top Contributing Authors

-	Use the Author tab on search results to:
-	View frequency of author appearances
-	Identify those with many articles in your topic

✅ Tip: Use “Analyze Results” → “Authors” to rank by publication count.

---


#### 🔹 Step 4: Export Authors to InCites for Evaluation

InCites Workflow:

1.	Open InCites → Select Researchers module
2.	Input/Upload identified authors from WoS
3.	Use filters to focus on:
    -	Region, Institution (optional)
    -	Time range

✅ InCites will compute:

-	CNCI (Category Normalized Citation Impact)
-	Total Output (papers)
-	H-index, % in Top 1%/10% papers
-	International collaboration %

#### 🔹 Step 5: Rank Experts by Objective Metrics

Use these ranking criteria:

| Rank Factor | Description                                      | Why Important                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 📈 CNCI     | Field-normalized citation impact                  | Measures quality vs. global peers |
| 📚 Output   | Number of topic-specific publications             | Indicates productivity         |
| 🧠 H-index  | Combined productivity and citation impact         | Reflects sustained influence   |
| 🌍 Collab % | Percentage of international collaborations        | Shows global research reach    |
| 🔝 %Top1%   | Share of papers in top 1% by citations            | Highlights leadership in field |

✅ Tip: Combine metrics in a weighted score or visual dashboard.

---


#### 🔹 Step 6: Validate Profiles Manually

-	Cross-check high-ranking authors in:
-	ORCID
-	Google Scholar
-	Institutional pages
-	Look for:
-	Consistency of work in topic
-	Recent activity
-	Affiliation fit for collaboration

### 🧠 Optional Enhancements


| Enhancement                                 | Tool/Resource                        |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Visualize co-authorship & institution map    | InCites Collaboration module         |
| Add grant/funding information                | Link with Dimensions or funder databases |
| Create alerts for new top papers/authors     | WoS saved search or alerts           |



### ✅ Example: AI in Medical Imaging

| Author     | CNCI | Output | H-index | Intl. Collab | Institution |
|------------|------|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Dr. Smith  | 4.5  | 23     | 18      | 72%          | Stanford    |
| Dr. Lee    | 3.8  | 19     | 15      | 60%          | NUS         |
| Dr. Zhang  | 5.2  | 30     | 20      | 85%          | Tsinghua    |


→ Top ranked expert: Dr. Zhang (balanced impact, output, intl. reach)
