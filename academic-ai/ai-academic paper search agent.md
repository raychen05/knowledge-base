## Complete LangChain OutputParser Schema


Here is a complete LangChain OutputParser schema for the structured academic paper extraction prompt you requested. This uses the PydanticOutputParser for automatic validation and structured output, fully compatible with LangChain agents, chains, or RAG pipelines.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define the Pydantic Model

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class AcademicPaperSummary(BaseModel):
    title: str
    year: Optional[str] = Field(description="Year of publication")
    authors: List[str]
    affiliations: List[str]
    objective: str
    method: str
    results: str
    datasets: List[str]
    models_or_tools: List[str]
    contributions: str
    comparison_to_prior_work: str
    evaluation_metrics: List[str]
    limitations: str
    application_domain: str
    paper_type: str  # e.g., 'survey', 'experimental', 'theoretical'
    code_or_data_link: Optional[str]
    citation_count: Optional[int]
    keywords: List[str]
    related_papers: List[str]
    lay_summary: str

```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create the LangChain Output Parser

```python
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser

paper_summary_parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=AcademicPaperSummary)

```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Integrate with Prompt Template

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
You are an AI assistant that extracts structured insights from academic papers for researchers.

Analyze the paper below and extract the following fields:
- Title
- Year
- Authors
- Affiliations
- Research Objective
- Method
- Key Results
- Datasets Used
- Models or Tools
- Contributions / Novelty
- Comparison to Prior Work
- Evaluation Metrics
- Limitations / Future Work
- Application Domain
- Paper Type
- Code or Data Link
- Citation Count
- Keywords
- Related Papers
- Lay Summary (for non-experts)

Return your output as a valid JSON matching this format:
{format_instructions}

--- Paper Start ---
Title: {paper_title}
Abstract: {paper_abstract}
--- Paper End ---
""",
    input_variables=["paper_title", "paper_abstract"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": paper_summary_parser.get_format_instructions()}
)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Use in a Chain

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")

chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=prompt,
    output_parser=paper_summary_parser
)

# Example usage
response = chain.run({
    "paper_title": "Efficient Transformers for Long Document Classification",
    "paper_abstract": "We propose a new transformer variant called LongFormer..."
})

# Structured output
print(response.dict())
```

### üß† Notes:

- 	You can extend the model to include full_text_chunks: List[str] if doing RAG-style extraction.
- 	This setup is compatible with LangGraph or tool-using agents that chain search ‚Üí summarization.
- 	Add a validator if you want to ensure values like citation_count are non-negative or paper_type is in a list.

## A Complete end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline


Here‚Äôs a complete end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using your structured academic paper summary prompt. This setup lets you:

---

‚úÖ Upload academic papers (PDF, CSV, JSON, or plaintext)
‚úÖ Ingest and chunk them into a vector store (FAISS or Chroma)
‚úÖ Search semantically with a user query
‚úÖ Use LLM to extract structured insights from the retrieved documents
‚úÖ Display extracted metadata in structured format (JSON / UI)

### üß± Components


#### 1. rag_config.py ‚Äì Basic Config

```python
# rag_config.py
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, PyMuPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
import os

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

def load_and_chunk_docs(file_path: str) -> list[Document]:
    if file_path.endswith(".pdf"):
        loader = PyMuPDFLoader(file_path)
    else:
        loader = TextLoader(file_path)

    docs = loader.load()
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)
    return splitter.split_documents(docs)

def build_vectorstore(documents: list[Document]) -> FAISS:
    return FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
```


---

#### 2. structured_prompt.py ‚Äì Your LLM Prompt and Parser

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from parser import AcademicPaperSummary  # Pydantic model from earlier
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=AcademicPaperSummary)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["context"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()},
    template="""
You are an AI academic research assistant. Analyze the provided academic content
and extract structured metadata as follows:

{format_instructions}

Context:
{context}
"""
)

rag_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=template,
    output_parser=parser
)
```

---

#### 3. rag_runner.py ‚Äì Full RAG Flow

```python
from rag_config import load_and_chunk_docs, build_vectorstore
from structured_prompt import rag_chain

def run_rag_pipeline(file_path: str, user_query: str):
    print("üìÑ Loading and chunking document...")
    docs = load_and_chunk_docs(file_path)
    
    print("üß† Building vector store...")
    vs = build_vectorstore(docs)

    print("üîç Performing semantic search...")
    results = vs.similarity_search(user_query, k=3)
    context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in results])

    print("üìù Running LLM for structured summary...")
    structured_output = rag_chain.run({"context": context})

    return structured_output
```


---

#### 4. app.py ‚Äì Streamlit UI


```python
import streamlit as st
from rag_runner import run_rag_pipeline

st.set_page_config(page_title="Academic RAG Summarizer", layout="wide")
st.title("üìö End-to-End RAG for Academic Paper Summarization")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a paper (PDF or TXT)", type=["pdf", "txt"])
query = st.text_input("Enter your search query (e.g., 'novel methods for protein folding')")

if uploaded_file and query:
    with open(f"./tmp_input.{uploaded_file.name.split('.')[-1]}", "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.read())

    with st.spinner("Running RAG pipeline..."):
        try:
            result = run_rag_pipeline(f.name, query)
            st.success("‚úÖ Extracted Paper Summary:")
            st.json(result.dict())
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Error: {e}")
```

### üß† Possible Next Features

- 	Add PDF metadata extraction (title, authors) automatically.
- 	Integrate citation graph + CoCitation retrieval for improved relevance.
- 	Store results in SQLite / JSONL for persistence.
- 	Support multi-paper summaries and clustering (group by topic or method).


Example input

```json
{
  "title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding",
  "abstract": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of NLP tasks. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, including question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications."
