## AI-powered Academic Expert Finder


Here are Top 10 Innovation Ideas and Key Features for an AI-powered Academic Expert Finder focused on high accuracy, ease of use, and top search functionality—designed to help users find the best experts for collaboration, peer review, speaking, consulting, or funding review.


### ✅ Top 10 Innovation Ideas & Features for Academic Expert Finder

#### 1. 🔍 Smart Semantic Search with Topic Matching

- What it does: Users can input a research question, paper title, abstract, or keyword, and the system semantically matches it to experts based on their publications and research themes.
- AI Tech: Embedding-based search (e.g., SPECTER, SciBERT), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- UX Feature: Natural language input (e.g., “Find experts in quantum error correction”).

#### 2. 🌐 Multi-Source Profile Aggregation

- What it does: Merges author data from Web of Science, Scopus, ORCID, Google Scholar, arXiv, grants databases, and patents to build holistic expert profiles.
- Benefit: More complete, cross-domain coverage of academic + applied expertise.

#### 3. 📈 Influence & Impact Ranking (Beyond H-Index)

- What it does: Experts are ranked using multi-factor models:
    - Topic relevance
    - Field-normalized citation impact
    - Recent activity
    - Co-authorship centrality
- AI Add-on: Learning-to-rank with feedback loop.

#### 4. 🧠 AI-Powered Expert Clustering and Topic Maps

- What it does: Visual maps of expert clusters by subdomain, institution, geography, or collaboration networks.
- Use Case: Discovering rising stars or thought leaders within a micro-topic.

#### 5. 🤝 Collaboration Fit Score

- What it does: Scores potential experts by:
    - Topical alignment
    - Past co-authorships
    - Common funders
    - Similar methodology
- UX: Filter for “likely to collaborate” or “no prior conflict”.

#### 6. 🧾 Context-Aware Filters (Reviewer Safe, Funded, Active)

- What it does: Filter experts by:
    - Availability (recent publication gap)
    - Funding status (active PI)
    - Institution type (R1, industry, startup, etc.)
    - Reviewer conflict detection (same org, coauthor, etc.)

#### 7. ✍️ Prompt-to-Expert (LLM Assistant)

- What it does: Users can describe their need in natural language:
    - “I need 3 reviewers for an AI + healthcare paper with no connection to Stanford”
- AI Tech: LLM + structured search constraint translation.

#### 8. 📅 Expert Timeline & Trajectory Viewer

- What it does: Shows evolution of an expert's focus over time.
- Use Case: Identifying domain-switching researchers or emerging leaders.

#### 9. 🔁 One-Click Expert Recommendation for Grant/Journal/Patent

- What it does: Upload a paper, proposal, or abstract → get top 10 expert recommendations (with rationales).
- AI Output: Expert + why they’re relevant (semantic match + citations + recent work).

#### 10. 🧾 Explainable Expert Matching

- What it does: Each result includes an explanation:
    - “Matched because of 3 papers in X, recent grant in Y, citation overlap with Z”
- Boosts: Transparency and trust in results.

Here's a working LLM prompt template for the AI-powered Academic Expert Finder that takes a research topic or document and returns top expert recommendations with reasoning:

### 🧠 LLM Prompt Template: Expert Finder

```plaintext

You are an expert recommender system for academic research. Given a paper title, abstract, or research question, identify and rank the most relevant academic experts.

Return a list of experts with:
- Full name
- Affiliation
- Areas of expertise
- Why they are relevant (semantic match, citations, recent work)
- Conflict of interest risks (if any)
- Contact info (if available)

Only return experts who are actively publishing in the last 3 years.

### Input:
Title: {{title}}

Abstract or Topic Description:
{{abstract}}

Optional Constraints:
- Exclude authors from institution: {{excluded_institution}}
- Must have ≥ {{min_citations}} citations
- Prefer region: {{preferred_region}}
- Must NOT have coauthored with: {{excluded_authors}}

### Output Format (JSON):
[
  {
    "name": "Dr. Jane Doe",
    "affiliation": "University of Oxford",
    "expertise": ["quantum error correction", "topological codes"],
    "relevance_reason": "Has published 5 papers on quantum error correction in the past 3 years, including one cited in the given abstract.",
    "conflict_risks": ["Previously collaborated with author A.B."],
    "contact": "jane.doe@ox.ac.uk"
  },
  ...
]
```

### ✅ Supports:

- Natural language input
- Automatic semantic expert matching
- Conflict checking
- Relevance reasoning (explainable AI)
- JSON output for UI integration
