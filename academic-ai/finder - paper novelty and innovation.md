## Paper Novelty and Innovation Analysis


To objectively assess the novelty, creativity, uniqueness, and innovation of a paper on a given research topic using Web of Science (WoS) and InCites, a researcher can follow the methodology below. This approach helps compare the paper’s originality and innovation against the existing body of work in a systematic and data-driven way.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Evaluate how novel, creative, or innovative a specific paper is compared to other published papers in the same or closely related research areas.

---

###🧭 Step-by-Step Methodology (Intuitive & Efficient)



#### 🔹 Step 1: Identify the Target Paper

-	Extract from the paper:
-	Title
-	Abstract
-	Author keywords
-	Keywords Plus (if available)
-	Research topic category

✅ You can do this from WoS directly or from the PDF using NLP tools.

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Build the Topical Search Set in Web of Science

Use the extracted keywords, topic phrases, and synonyms to define a search strategy for the topic corpus.

Example search (Topic: “graphene-based biosensors”):

TS=("graphene biosensor*" OR "graphene-based sensor*")

Apply filters:
-	Document type: Article, Review
-	Years: Last 5–10 years (to capture current state of the art)
-	WoS Categories: Biomedical Engineering, Analytical Chemistry, etc.

✅ This builds the topic reference corpus to compare against.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Cluster & Analyze the Topic Corpus

Use WoS “Analyze Results” and export data (title, abstract, keywords) for text analysis. Apply:

-	Topic modeling (e.g. LDA, BERTopic)
-	TF-IDF keyword analysis
-	Clustering or embedding-based grouping (e.g., using SentenceTransformers)

This helps reveal:

-	Common themes
-	Dense clusters (popular ideas)
-	Sparse or outlier themes (potentially novel directions)

✅ Identify where your target paper fits in this space.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Semantic Similarity to Detect Novelty

Embed the abstract or full text of the paper using a language model (e.g. all-MiniLM, SciBERT), and compute cosine similarity with all papers in the reference corpus.

-	High similarity → typical work
-	Low similarity → more novel (semantically dissimilar to peers)

✅ Rank your paper’s similarity score percentile to objectively assess novelty.

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: Citation Overlap and Network Diff

Check:

-	Cited references of the paper vs. corpus
-	Use WoS Citation Network → Citation Map
-	See if the paper cites core prior works or branches into new citation paths

✅ Papers citing unusual or interdisciplinary sources may reflect innovation.

---

#### 🔹 Step 6: Novel Keyword/Term Detection

Run a frequency comparison:

-	Identify the top 100 keywords/phrases in topic corpus
-	Compare with keywords/phrases in your paper

Highlight:

-	New terms not in corpus
-	Unusual combinations of known terms

✅ Using new or rarely combined concepts = creativity signal.

---

#### 🔹 Step 7: Evaluate InCites Indicators (if Published)

If the paper is already published:

-	Use InCites Benchmarking & Analytics
-	Metrics to check:
-	CNCI (Category Normalized Citation Impact)
-	Top 1%/10% papers
-	Collaboration types (interdisciplinary = innovation)
-	% Self-citations (low = impact beyond author network)

✅ High CNCI + early citation → signals innovation.

---

#### 🔹 Step 8: Check for Patents and Commercial Potential

In WoS:

-	Switch to Patent document types
-	Check if:
-	Similar ideas have been patented
-	Your paper overlaps with existing IP

✅ If no prior patents, high novelty; if cited by patents, shows applied innovation.

#### 🔹 Step 9: Summarize Findings (Novelty Report Template)


| Dimension         | Evidence                   | Score         |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Topic similarity  | Cosine sim: 0.41 (low)    | ✅ Novel       |
| Keyword overlap   | 5/30 new phrases          | ✅ Creative    |
| Citation path     | Interdisciplinary refs    | ✅ Unique      |
| Patent overlap    | No match                  | ✅ Innovative  |
| CNCI (if pub)     | 3.2 (top 10%)             | ✅ Impactful   |



#### 🛠 Optional Tools to Automate


| Tool                                 | Purpose                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| WoS Core Collection                   | Corpus generation, citation mapping     |
| InCites                              | Citation impact benchmarking            |
| SciBERT, MiniLM, BERTopic             | Text embedding & clustering             |
| LangChain + WoS API                   | Automate the full analysis pipeline     |
| NLP pipeline (spaCy, scikit-learn)    | Keyword and novelty detection           |
