## Find Topic Research Status

Here is a detailed, intuitive, and efficient methodology that a researcher (PhD or professor) can follow using Web of Science (WoS) and InCites to objectively assess whether a research topic has been studied, how extensively it has been published, whether it’s still hot, if any patents exist, and whether it’s trending up or down.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Determine whether a specific research topic or direction is novel, active, impactful, or declining, using objective publication, citation, funding, and patent metrics from Web of Science and InCites.

---

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Methodology



#### 🔹 Step 1: Define the Topic Precisely

Start by crafting a search query using:
-	Keywords and synonyms
-	Boolean logic (AND, OR)
-	Quotation marks for exact phrases

Example (Topic: Self-healing polymers for wearable electronics):

TS=("self-healing polymer*" AND "wearable electronic*")


✅ Use wildcard * to catch word variants (e.g., “polymer”/“polymers”)

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Check for Existing Publications in Web of Science

1.	Go to Web of Science Core Collection
2.	Input your search query
3.	Apply filters:
    -	Document types: Article, Review, Patent
    -	Time span: last 10 years (or custom range)

Key Metrics to Observe:
-	Total number of publications
-	Publication trend over time
-	Top authors, journals, countries
-	Cited references (are others building on this?)

✅ Use “Analyze Results” to generate these breakdowns.

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Identify Related Topics and Fields

-	Use Web of Science Categories and Keywords Plus tabs
-	Analyze:
-	What other terms commonly co-occur?
-	Which related subfields are most cited?

✅ This helps position your topic among existing research landscapes.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Detect Patent Activity

1.	In the Web of Science filters, select:
    -	Document type: Patent

2.	Re-run your search or reapply to existing result set
3.	Export and analyze:
    -	Patent assignees (institutions, companies)
    -	Filing countries
    -	Time trend (how recent?)

✅ If no patents → potential opportunity!

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: Analyze Temporal Trends (Hot or Fading?)

Use the “Publication Year” graph in WoS:
-	Are the number of articles increasing or declining?
-	Are citations per year growing or shrinking?

Optionally:
-	Export yearly data and visualize in Excel or a charting tool

✅ Use citation trajectory to infer impact sustainability.

---

#### 🔹 Step 6: Deep Trend and Impact Analysis in InCites

Switch to InCites for field-normalized, quantitative insights.

1.	Open InCites → Use Research Areas or Custom Dataset
2.	Input the topic query or WoS-exported article set
3.	Key InCites Indicators:
    -	📈 Output over Time (growth or decline)
    -	🔥 % Documents in Top 1%/10% (impact level)
    -	🧠 CNCI (field-normalized citation impact)
    -	💵 % with Funding Acknowledgment (funding trend)

✅ Filter by year to spot surges or drop-offs.

---

#### 🔹 Step 7: Benchmark Against Related Topics
1.	In InCites → Compare multiple research topics side-by-side:
    -	Your chosen topic
    -	Related areas (e.g., biodegradable sensors, stretchable electronics)
2.	Compare:
    -	CNCI
    -	Funding %
    -	Recent Output
    -	Cited half-life

✅ Use this to determine if your topic is more impactful or not.

#### 🔹 Step 8: Final Novelty & Opportunity Assessment


| Indicator                                      | Interpretation                |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 🟢 Low publication count + recent growth        | Emerging topic                |
| 🟡 High publication count + recent slowdown     | Mature but declining          |
| 🔴 No publications or patents                   | Novel or off-trend            |
| 🔥 High CNCI + high funding + recent growth     | High potential                |
