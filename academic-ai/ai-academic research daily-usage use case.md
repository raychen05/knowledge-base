## Top 20 Daily-Usage AI Use Cases


Excellent — this is an important next layer: instead of strategic or long-term use cases (which we covered before), you now want “daily-usage” or “operational” use cases — the kinds of AI tools or workflows that each stakeholder would use every day in their academic or research routine.
