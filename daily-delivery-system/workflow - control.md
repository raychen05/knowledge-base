##  Job Worflow Control in Databricks

To trigger multiple jobs in sequence or parallel and recover from failure in a data pipeline workflow, we need to consider several aspects:

---

### 1. Methodology & Approach:

1.	Job Execution: Trigger jobs in sequence or parallel based on dependencies and required concurrency.
-	Sequential execution: Trigger each job one after the other, waiting for the previous one to finish.
-	Parallel execution: Trigger jobs simultaneously, independent of each other.

2.	Error Handling and Recovery:
-	Retry Mechanism: On job failure, we should implement automatic retries for a certain number of attempts before marking it as a failure.
-	Failure Recovery: On failure, trigger alert notifications (e.g., via email or dashboards) and log failure details. Optionally, rollback to the last known good state of the job.
-	Job Rollback: When a job fails, rollback to a previously known successful state (using Delta Lake or equivalent).

3.	Alerting: Set up notifications using email, Slack, or custom monitoring systems to inform stakeholders when a failure occurs.

4.	Workflow Configuration: Use tools like Databricks Jobs, Airflow, or custom scripts to automate the workflow.

---


### 2. Steps to Configure Workflow:

1.	Define Jobs: Each job in the pipeline should be defined as a separate unit of work, with dependencies set for sequential or parallel execution.
2.	Retry Mechanism: Set a retry limit for each job.
3.	Error Handling: Catch exceptions and handle failures with appropriate logging, alerts, and rollback steps.
4.	Rollback: Use Delta Lake or equivalent to ensure that changes can be reverted to a previous state in case of failure.
5.	Alerting: Use email or another system to notify stakeholders in case of failure.

### 3. Scala Example: Automatic Pipeline Workflow with Retry, Failure Recovery, Alerting, and Rollback

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import io.delta.tables._
import scala.util.control.Breaks._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("DataPipelineWorkflow").getOrCreate()

// Task names
val taskNames = Seq("task1", "task2", "task3")

// Retry settings
val maxRetries = 3
val retryDelay = 5.seconds

// Simulating a function that runs the task and handles retries
def runJobWithRetry(taskName: String, jobFunc: () => Unit): Unit = {
  var attempt = 0
  var success = false
  breakable {
    while (attempt < maxRetries) {
      try {
        println(s"Running task: $taskName (Attempt ${attempt + 1})")
        jobFunc()  // Run the actual job function
        success = true
        println(s"Task $taskName completed successfully.")
        break
      } catch {
        case e: Exception =>
          attempt += 1
          println(s"Task $taskName failed (Attempt ${attempt}) due to: ${e.getMessage}")
          if (attempt >= maxRetries) {
            // Log failure and alert
            sendAlert(s"Task $taskName failed after $maxRetries attempts.")
            handleFailure(taskName, e)
            throw e  // Rethrow to stop the pipeline
          }
          println(s"Retrying task $taskName in ${retryDelay.toSeconds} seconds...")
          Thread.sleep(retryDelay.toMillis)  // Delay before retry
      }
    }
  }
}

// Define a sample job function (this would be your actual task logic)
def sampleJob(taskName: String): Unit = {
  if (taskName == "task2") throw new RuntimeException("Simulated task failure")
  // Actual job logic (e.g., reading data, processing, etc.)
  println(s"Processing data for task: $taskName")
}

// Function to send alerts (can be via email, Slack, etc.)
def sendAlert(message: String): Unit = {
  println(s"ALERT: $message")
  // Implement email or Slack alerting here
}

// Function to handle failure, including logging and rollback
def handleFailure(taskName: String, e: Exception): Unit = {
  // Log the error in Delta Table or other systems
  println(s"Logging failure for $taskName: ${e.getMessage}")
  
  // Rollback to the previous successful state if using Delta Lake
  val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "dbfs:/mnt/delta/staging_table")
  deltaTable.restoreToVersion(1)  // Assuming version 1 is the last successful state
  
  // Send failure alerts
  sendAlert(s"Task $taskName failed: ${e.getMessage}")
}

try {
  // Sequential Execution (Can also use parallel execution with Future or other concurrency mechanisms)
  taskNames.foreach { taskName =>
    runJobWithRetry(taskName, () => sampleJob(taskName))
  }

} catch {
  case e: Exception =>
    println(s"Pipeline execution failed due to: ${e.getMessage}")
    // Handle overall failure of the pipeline
    sendAlert(s"Pipeline execution failed: ${e.getMessage}")
    // Optionally, rollback entire pipeline state here if needed
}
```

---

### 4. Key Components:

1.	Job Retry Mechanism: The runJobWithRetry function retries the job up to maxRetries times before failing.
2.	Error Handling: If a job fails, an alert is sent, the error is logged, and a rollback operation is triggered using Delta Lake.
3.	Rollback: If a job fails, the previous successful version of the Delta table is restored.
4.	Alerting: Alerts are sent using the sendAlert function (could be expanded to send emails, messages to Slack, etc.).
5.	Sequential Execution: Jobs are executed one after another in the taskNames.foreach loop. For parallel execution, you could use concurrency features such as Scala Futures.
6.	Logging Failure: When a job fails, the error is logged and a failure message is sent.

---

### 5. Configuring the Workflow:

-	Job Dependencies: In Databricks, you can configure job dependencies in the Job UI, where jobs can be set to run sequentially or in parallel.
-	Retries and Recovery: Databricks jobs offer built-in retry mechanisms that you can configure. For more fine-grained control, you can implement your own retry logic as shown above.

---

### 6. Next Steps:

-	Alerting: You can configure email notifications or use Databricks’ built-in alerting system for better observability.
-	Logging: Store error logs and job statuses in a centralized location (e.g., Delta table, log aggregation tools).
-	Data Quality Checks: Add checks for data quality before moving to the next job (e.g., schema validation, row count validation).

##  Running Multiple Jobs vs. Running Multiple Tasks in One Job: Performance & Trade-offs



When orchestrating workflows in Databricks, you can choose between:
- 1️⃣ Running Multiple Jobs (Independent Jobs per Task)
- 2️⃣ Running Multiple Tasks in One Job (Job with Multiple Tasks)


---

### 📌 1. Running Multiple Jobs (Independent Jobs per Task)

Each task is configured as a separate Databricks job, and dependencies are managed at the job level.

✅ Pros:

- ✔ Better Resource Isolation → Each job runs on its own cluster (if needed), avoiding resource contention.
- ✔ Granular Failure Handling → If one job fails, others are not impacted.
- ✔ Flexible Scheduling → Jobs can have different triggers, retries, or schedules.
- ✔ Different Cluster Configurations → Customize clusters per job (e.g., different node sizes, memory, libraries).

❌ Cons:

- ❌ Higher Cost → Spinning up separate clusters per job leads to higher costs.
- ❌ Slower Execution → Cluster spin-up time can delay execution if using separate clusters.
- ❌ More Complex Orchestration → Dependency management needs additional setup via Databricks Workflows or external orchestrators like Apache Airflow.

🚀 Best Use Cases:

- ✅ Large, independent workloads that need separate compute environments.
- ✅ Workflows with different compute requirements per step (e.g., one job uses GPU, another uses CPU).
- ✅ ETL Pipelines processing high-volume data where each step is heavy and resource-intensive.

---

### 📌 2. Running Multiple Tasks in One Job (Job with Multiple Tasks)

Here, multiple tasks (notebooks, JARs, Python scripts) are executed within a single Databricks job. Dependencies are defined inside the job.

✅ Pros:

- ✔ Lower Cost → Tasks share the same cluster, reducing costs.
- ✔ Faster Execution → No cluster spin-up delay between tasks.
- ✔ Simplified Orchestration → Manage dependencies within one job without external tools.
- ✔ Easier Monitoring → One job to monitor instead of multiple separate jobs.

❌ Cons:

- ❌ Resource Contention → Multiple tasks sharing the same cluster may slow down performance.
- ❌ Limited Flexibility → All tasks must run on the same cluster type and version.
- ❌ Failure Handling → If a cluster crashes, all tasks within the job fail.

🚀 Best Use Cases:

- ✅ Smaller, interdependent workloads that process manageable data sizes.
- ✅ Use cases where cost optimization is crucial, and clusters can be shared efficiently.
- ✅ Scenarios where rapid execution is needed without waiting for new clusters to spin up.

### 📊 Performance & Trade-off Summary


| **Factor**           | **Multiple Jobs** 🚀 | **Multiple Tasks in One Job** ⚡ |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (cluster startup per job) | Faster (shared cluster) |
| **Resource Usage**  | More resources (each job may use its own cluster) | Less efficient if too many tasks run on the same cluster |
| **Cost**            | Higher (more clusters = more cost) | Lower (one cluster shared) |
| **Orchestration Complexity** | More complex (managing dependencies across jobs) | Simpler (all dependencies managed within one job) |
| **Failure Isolation** | High (one job failure doesn’t impact others) | Lower (one failure can stop all tasks) |
| **Flexibility**      | High (different clusters, libraries, configurations per job) | Low (all tasks share the same cluster config) |


---

### 💡 Which Approach to Choose?

🚀 Choose Multiple Jobs when:
- ✅ Large data processing workloads with different cluster needs.
- ✅ Jobs require different compute configurations (e.g., GPU for ML, large memory for ETL).
- ✅ Workloads are independent and can run on separate schedules.

⚡ Choose Multiple Tasks in One Job when:
- ✅ You need to reduce cluster costs and optimize resource usage.
- ✅ Tasks are lightweight and interdependent (e.g., reading, transforming, and writing small data).
- ✅ You want faster execution without waiting for cluster startup.

🚀 Hybrid Approach → Run lightweight tasks in a single job but use separate jobs for heavy workloads to balance cost, speed, and flexibility.

## Running Multiple Jobs in Databricks with Workflow Dependencies: Shared or Separate Clusters?


When running multiple jobs in Databricks Workflows, you can choose between:
- 1️⃣ Using the Same Cluster for All Jobs
- 2️⃣ Using Separate Clusters for Each Job

---

### 📌 1. Using the Same Cluster for All Jobs

✔ Best for: Faster execution, optimized resource usage
❌ Downsides: Potential resource contention

✅ How It Works?
-	All jobs run on the same Databricks cluster.
-	Jobs can share cached data and resources.
-	No additional cluster spin-up time.

🔹 Example Configuration (Using Same Cluster)

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow with Shared Cluster",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_key": "job_A",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobA" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>"
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_B",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobB" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>"
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_C",
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobC" },
      "existing_cluster_id": "<CLUSTER_ID>",
      "depends_on": [{ "task_key": "job_A" }, { "task_key": "job_B" }]
    }
  ]
}

```

✔ Effect:
-	Job A & Job B run in parallel on the same cluster.
-	Job C starts only after Job A & Job B complete.

💡 Use when jobs share large datasets in Delta Lake.


---

### 📌 2. Using Separate Clusters for Each Job

✔ Best for: Resource isolation, better stability
❌ Downsides: Higher cost, additional cluster spin-up time

✅ How It Works?
-	Each job runs on its own dedicated cluster.
-	No resource contention between jobs.
-	Cluster settings can be customized per job.

🔹 Example Configuration (Separate Clusters)

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow with Separate Clusters",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_key": "job_A",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobA" }
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_B",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobB" }
    },
    {
      "task_key": "job_C",
      "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2"
      },
      "notebook_task": { "notebook_path": "/Shared/JobC" },
      "depends_on": [{ "task_key": "job_A" }, { "task_key": "job_B" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

✔ Effect:
-	Each job runs on its own cluster.
-	No resource contention, but slower startup due to cluster initialization.

💡 Use when jobs require different compute configurations.

### 📌 3. Which One to Choose?


Option|	Use When|	Pros|	Cons|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
Same Cluster	|Jobs share data & resources|	Faster execution, reduced cost|	Possible resource contention|
Separate Clusters|	Jobs have different compute needs|	No contention, stable	|Higher cost, slower startup|


- ✅ For most workflows → Use the same cluster if jobs are lightweight & interdependent.
- ✅ For heavy workloads → Use separate clusters to avoid bottlenecks.

🚀 Hybrid Approach:
-	Use the same cluster for small/medium jobs.
-	Use separate clusters for heavy ETL workloads like model training or massive transformations.
