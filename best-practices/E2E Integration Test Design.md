## Practical End-to-End Integration Test Design


Below is a complete, practical End-to-End Integration Test design + test plan + delivery checklist tailored for your daily delivery system (Databricks catalog → processing pipelines → validation → Elasticsearch load) that handles large incremental and baseline data. I’ve included test strategy, test cases, automation ideas, monitoring/alerting, rollback/DR, acceptance criteria, and a concise delivery checklist you can use before go-live. Use/modify it to match your CI/CD and tooling.

---

### Overview & goals


**Goal**: validate the entire daily delivery pipeline from Databricks catalog (≥3 schemas, 80+ tables) through ETL/validation/aggregation to outputs (10+ entities, ~300 article-level metrics, ~60 metadata fields) and final indexing into Elasticsearch — for both incremental and baseline loads — ensuring correctness, performance, reliability, observability and safe recovery.

**Primary success criteria**

- All article-level metrics and metadata are correct and complete for sample and production-like datasets.
- Incremental updates correctly apply deltas (inserts/updates/deletes) without duplication or loss.
- Performance meets SLA (daily window completes within allowed time).
- End-to-end observability, automated validations and safe rollback exist.


---

### High-level architecture to test

1. Source: Databricks Catalog (schemas/tables).
2. Ingestion/Loader: batch jobs (Spark/Databricks jobs) for baseline and incremental loads.
3. Preprocessing: joins, enrichments, dedup, normalization (author/institution normalization).
4. Validation: schema checks, business rules, N+ anomaly detection, data quality metrics.
5. Aggregation/Entity model: produce entities (10+) and article metrics (~300).
6. Staging store / Catalog: store outputs (Parquet/Delta) with partitions and dataset versioning.
7. Index Pipeline: ES transformers, mapping validation, bulk index to ES cluster.
8. Post-load QC: index verification, search sampling, counts, checksum comparisons.
9. Orchestration/Workflow: DAG engine (Airflow/Databricks Jobs/etc.) with retries, dependencies, alerting.
10. Consumers: downstream dashboards, APIs — smoke tests.

---

### Test strategy & types

- **Unit tests**: for transformation functions, normalization logic, validation rules (run in CI).
- **Component tests**: single job with mocked inputs and outputs.
- **Integration tests** (focus of this plan): run full pipelines on production-like environment with test datasets that exercise variants.
- **End-to-end tests**: full run from Databricks catalog reading to final ES index and downstream smoke checks.
- **Regression tests**: compare new outputs vs baseline (golden) outputs.
- **Performance & Load tests**: verify throughput and SLA for daily load and peak scenarios.
- **Chaos / Resilience tests**: job/task failures, partial ES outage, network partitions, schema drift.
- **Security tests**: RBAC, credentials rotation, encryption at rest/in transit, audit logs.
- **Data privacy & compliance tests**: PII detection/redaction checks.

---

### Test environments

- **Dev**: unit + component work; synthetic small datasets.
- **QA / Preprod** (must mimic prod): full end-to-end runs using sampled production-like data (mask PII) — used for main integration tests.
- **Prod**: run monitoring checks and canary incremental runs before full production commit.

Recommendation: keep a dedicated ES cluster for QA with same mappings/settings as prod, and a Databricks workspace with similar worker sizes (or scaled down but representative).


---

### Test data design


- **Golden baseline**: snapshot of production sample (delta & baseline) with known expected outputs.
- **Incremental series**: sequences of daily change sets to validate upserts, deletes, partial updates.
- **Edge cases**:
    - Empty fields, nulls, very long strings
    - Duplicate records (same DOIs/IDs)
    - Conflicting updates (out-of-order timestamps)
    - Schema evolution (new column added / type change)
    - Corrupt rows, invalid codes
- **Volume cases**:
    - Small (smoke)
    - Medium (typical day)
    - Large (spike / backfill — e.g., 5–20x typical)
- **Anomaly scenarios**:
    - Missing partition(s)
    - Late arriving data (older timestamps)
    - Cross-schema referential breaks
- **Security sample**: PII sample that must be masked or redacted.

Store test datasets in a versioned location (e.g., s3://bucket/testdata/yyyy-mm-dd/{baseline|incremental}/) and keep metadata about expected outputs for automated diffing.

### Integration test plan (phases & steps)


#### Phase 1 — Pre-run checks (automated)

1. Validate Databricks catalog presence & schema versions for all expected input tables (compare schema hashes).
2. Verify job DAG dependencies and scheduled windows.
3. Verify source partitions exist for the date range to process.
4. Verify credentials & connectivity to ES and required services.
5. Verify available compute resources & cluster autoscaling configs.


#### Phase 2 — Baseline run(s)

1. Load baseline dataset into staging.
2. Run full pipeline (baseline path) end-to-end.
3. Capture:
    - Job logs (stdout/stderr)
    - Spark metrics (executor time, shuffle, memory spill)
    - Output dataset versions & record counts per table/entity
4. Run data validations (see validation list below).
5. Compare outputs to golden baseline expected results (row counts, summary checksums, sampled record equality).


#### Phase 3 — Incremental run(s)

1. Apply incremental changesets (day-1, day-2...).
2. Run incremental loader with delta logic.
3. Validate upserts/soft deletes/hard deletes as expected:
    - No duplicates for the same unique key.
    - Updated fields reflect latest timestamps.
4. Recompute article metrics that depend on incremental changes and compare with expected.


#### Phase 4 — ES index tests

1. Validate mapping compatibility (no dynamic mapping changes).
2. Bulk index test: measure bulk sizes, batch sizes, response codes.
3. After indexing, run:
    - Document counts per index vs expected.
    - Random sample retrieval and field value verification.
    - Aggregation queries (top N authors, counts by year) and compare to expected DB outputs.
4. Test idempotency: reindex same data twice → counts unchanged and no duplicates.


#### Phase 5 — Downstream / consumer smoke tests

1. Execute representative queries used by dashboards and APIs (latency & correctness).
2. Verify document enrichment fields used by consumers are present and valid.
3. Run end-to-end business workflows (e.g., generate a report) and compare numbers.


#### Phase 6 — Failure & recovery tests

1. Simulate job failures (kill executor, fail job mid-write) and verify:
    - Partial outputs are rolled back or flagged.
    - Orchestration retries restore to consistent state.
2. Simulate ES write rejects (quota / mapping error) and verify alert & rollback behavior.
3. Test rollback procedure from last successful output snapshot (reindex from snapshot).
4. Run disaster recovery: restore from latest backup and reindex — verify parity.


#### Phase 7 — Performance & scale tests

1. Run typical and peak-volume runs; measure end-to-end time vs SLA.
2. Stress ES with concurrent queries + indexing to validate concurrency.
3. Evaluate resource bottlenecks (IO, shuffle, GC).


#### Phase 8 — Regression & nightly automated runs

1. Implement nightly regression suite on QA with real incremental sample to catch drift.
2. Track metrics over time (data quality, job success rate, durations) for trend detection.

### Validation & acceptance checks (detailed)


**Structural / schema checks**
- All expected output fields present, types match spec.
- No unexpected columns.
- Partitioning scheme present and correct.

**Row-level checks**
- Row counts per dataset = expected (with tolerance).
- Key uniqueness: unique constraint per entity (e.g., article_id unique).
- No orphan references between entities (FK-like checks).

**Field/value checks**
- Mandatory fields non-null (title, id, publication date).
- Date ranges valid.
- Numeric ranges (citations >=0).
- Controlled vocab checks (journal codes, doc types).

**Business logic checks**
- Metric derivations validated (e.g., citation_count equals aggregated reference table).
- Normalization (author name canonicalization) deterministic and consistent.
- Aggregation windows (e.g., rolling 12-month metrics) match expected formulas.

**Delta checks for incremental loads**
- Upsert semantics correct: latest timestamp wins.
- Deleted records are removed or flagged.
- No duplication of worklogs/metrics.

**ES index checks**
- Mappings: field types & analyzers match spec.
- All expected documents indexed and searchable.
- Search results for representative sample queries match expected document sets.
- Aggregation results (counts) match output dataset totals.

**Consistency checks**
- Checksum / hash of dataset exported vs stored.
- Compare top-N lists (authors, journals) between data store and ES.

**Operational checks**
- Job success/exit codes.
- Expected logs and metrics exported to monitoring (Datadog/Prometheus).
- Alerts firing for failures and SLA breaches.

### Automation & tooling recommendations

- **CI**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins for unit/component tests.
- **Test orchestration**: Use Databricks Jobs + Airflow / Prefect to run automated integration test DAGs.
- **Test runner**: PyTest for Python transform logic; Spark testing via pytest-spark or spark-testing-base.
- **Data diffing**: Great Expectations for data quality checks + expectations suite; or dbt tests for SQL-based checks.
- **Comparison & golden tests**: deequ (Spark) or custom checksums; store golden outputs in versioned storage.
- **ES testing**: use ES test cluster, and pytest + elasticsearch-py to programmatically validate.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus / Datadog for job metrics, ES metrics; Grafana dashboards.
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty/SNS/Slack for critical failures; low-severity alerts to teams channel.
- **CI artifacts**: store job logs, Spark UI link snapshots, and test diffs in build artifacts.

### Example automated validation pseudocode (end-to-end)

```python
# pseudocode: run pipeline, then run checks
run_databricks_job(job_id="daily_pipeline", params={"date":"2025-10-20"})
wait_for_job_completion(timeout=6*3600)

# validations
assert job_status == "SUCCESS"
# row counts
src_counts = query_table("source.articles", "date='2025-10-20'")
out_counts = query_table("staging.article_entity", "partition='2025-10-20'")
assert out_counts == expected_counts

# sample value checks
sample = query("SELECT article_id, title, citations FROM staging.article_entity LIMIT 10")
for r in sample:
    assert r["title"] is not None
    assert r["citations"] >= 0

# ES checks
es_count = es.count(index="articles-2025-10-20")
assert es_count == out_counts
res = es.search(index="articles-2025-10-20", body={"query":{"match":{"title":"some unique phrase"}}})
assert len(res["hits"]["hits"]) >= 1
```

---

### Monitoring, observability & alerts

- **Job-level**: success/failures, duration, retries, last successful run timestamp.
- **Data quality metrics**: completeness rate, unique key violations, schema drift flag.
- **Throughput**: rows/hour, MB/s, ES ops/sec.
- **Error logs**: log aggregation with structured logs (JSON) and trace ids to correlate across systems.
- **Alerting**:
    - SEV1: pipeline failures, ES cluster red/green changes, data-losing bugs
    - SEV2: SLA misses, validation threshold breaches
    - SEV3: increasing error trend or non-critical anomalies
- **Dashboards**: daily pipeline health board, data quality board, ES indexing metrics, downstream consumer latency.

---

### Rollback & recovery strategy

- **Idempotent pipeline**: ensure jobs re-run safely (use write-modes like MERGE on Delta with primary key).
- **Versioned outputs**: write outputs with date/version and keep previous snapshots for quick rollback.
- **ES safe reindexing**: index to a new alias (articles_v2) then switch alias atomically.
- **Backups**: snapshot ES indices before bulk reindex. Keep data lake versions for quick restore.
- **Manual rollback plan**: documented runbook with commands to:
    1. Stop scheduled DAGs.
    2. Reindex from snapshot (or revert alias).
    3. Trigger smoke tests.
    4. Resume DAGs.

---

### Roles & responsibilities (RACI highlights)

- **Data Engineers**: implement pipelines, unit tests, run integration suite.
- **QA / SRE**: run & maintain E2E tests, monitoring, incident handling.
- **Product / Data Owners**: define acceptance criteria & golden datasets.
- **DevOps**: infra (clusters, ES), backups, secrets management.
- **On-call**: respond to SEV1/2 alerts with documented runbooks.

---

### Risk register (top risks & mitigations)


- Risk: Schema drift in source
    - Mitigation: Pre-run schema checks, soft-fail on unexpected columns, alert product owner.

- Risk: Duplicate or missing records during incremental
    - Mitigation: Strong key constraints, idempotent MERGE logic, regression test sequences.

- Risk: ES mapping changes cause indexing failure
    - Mitigation: Strict mapping enforcement, test mapping changes in QA, CI mapper checks.

- Risk: Performance degradation at scale
    - Mitigation: Load tests, autoscaling, resource limits, query pagination, bulk size tuning.

- Risk: Silent data corruption
    - Mitigation: Checksums, automated data quality alerts, periodic full data audits.

---

### Acceptance criteria (must be satisfied before go-live)


1. Integration tests pass end-to-end on QA for baseline and 7 days of incremental runs.
2. All automated validation checks pass (schema, uniqueness, business rules).
3. Performance tests meet SLA for typical and 2x typical day volumes.

### Quick templates & snippets you can reuse


**JQL-style pre-run check (pseudocode)**

```sql
-- verify expected partitions exist for date
SELECT partition, COUNT(*) FROM catalog.schema.table
WHERE partition='2025-10-20'
GROUP BY partition;
```


**ES alias reindex approach**

1. Index new data into articles_v2.
2. Validate counts & samples on articles_v2.
3. Atomically switch alias:
```bash
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {"remove": {"index": "articles_v1", "alias": "articles"}},
    {"add":    {"index": "articles_v2", "alias": "articles"}}
  ]
}
```

**Sample validation (SQL)**

```bash
-- uniqueness
SELECT article_id, COUNT(*) c
FROM staging.article_entity
GROUP BY article_id
HAVING c > 1;

-- null mandatory
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging.article_entity WHERE title IS NULL;
```

### Final notes & suggested next steps

1. Prioritize building the automated QA pipeline that runs nightly in preprod with regression diffs — that’s your best early warning system.
2. Start with a representative subset of tables/entities to get fast feedback, then scale tests to full datasets.
3. Automate golden dataset management and diffing to make regressions easy to find.
4. If you want, I can:
    - generate concrete Great Expectations suites for your key tables, or
    - produce a sample Databricks Job + Airflow DAG for the integration test workflow, or
    - create a templated test case matrix in CSV/Excel you can import into a test management tool.
Which of those would you like next?

Here’s a concise summary of the goal for the Integration Test Plan (Phases & Steps):

### 🎯 Goal of the Integration Test Plan

To verify that the entire end-to-end data delivery pipeline — from Databricks source tables to Elasticsearch indices — works correctly, consistently, and reliably under both baseline and incremental data processing scenarios.


#### 🧩 Key Objectives by Phase

| Phase                        | Goal / Purpose                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Pre-run Checks            | Ensure all inputs, schemas, dependencies, credentials, and environments are valid before starting.              |
| 2. Baseline Run              | Validate that a full (“from scratch”) pipeline run produces correct, complete, and consistent outputs.          |
| 3. Incremental Run           | Confirm that daily delta loads correctly apply inserts, updates, and deletes without duplication or data loss.  |
| 4. ES Index Tests            | Verify that output data is indexed into Elasticsearch correctly — with valid mappings, counts, and query results.|
| 5. Downstream Smoke Tests    | Ensure dashboards, APIs, or analytics consuming the indexed data function correctly and return expected results. |
| 6. Failure & Recovery Tests  | Prove the system can handle job or network failures gracefully, with retries and safe rollback/recovery.        |
| 7. Performance & Scale Tests | Check that the pipeline meets performance SLAs and remains stable under large or peak data volumes.             |
| 8. Regression & Nightly Automation | Continuously test against golden datasets to detect data drift, schema changes, or silent regressions early.|


#### ✅ Overall Outcome

After completing these phases, the system should:
- Process data accurately end-to-end.
- Handle both full and incremental loads safely.
- Recover automatically from common failures.
- Meet defined SLAs for time and data quality.
- Be fully observable and alert on issues.

### Test Strategy & Types Design

Excellent — here’s a structured, professional summary of the Goal and Methodology for your Test Strategy & Types Design, specifically tailored for your complex data processing and automation platform (Databricks → validation → entity/metric model → Elasticsearch).


#### 🎯 Goal of Test Strategy & Types Design

The goal of the test strategy is to design a comprehensive, risk-based testing framework that ensures:

1. **End-to-end data integrity** — every transformation from input to Elasticsearch output is correct, complete, and consistent.
2. **Process reliability** — workflows, schedulers, and job dependencies execute without failure or data loss.
3. **Incremental correctness** — daily incremental runs apply deltas (inserts/updates/deletes) correctly and idempotently.
4. **Performance and scalability** — the pipeline meets throughput and latency SLAs under both baseline and high-load conditions.
5. **System resilience and observability** — failures, schema drifts, and external outages are detected, alerted, and recoverable without corruption.
6. **Security and compliance** — data access, masking, and lineage controls meet internal and regulatory standards.

**In short:**
- Design a multi-layered testing strategy that proactively detects functional, data, and operational issues before they reach production.


#### 🧭 Methodology for Designing Test Strategy & Types

The methodology defines how to plan and structure the test coverage — from unit logic to full E2E workflows — focusing on critical system and data risks.

**1. Understand the System & Identify Critical Risks**
   
Map the entire data flow and identify high-risk areas that could impact reliability:

| Area                  | Example Risk                  | Testing Focus                       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data ingestion        | Missing or corrupt partitions | Schema and completeness checks      |
| Transformations       | Incorrect joins, lost records | Data reconciliation tests           |
| Incremental loads     | Duplicate or missing updates  | Upsert and delta logic tests        |
| Validation rules      | Incorrect filters, thresholds | Rule-based test suites              |
| ES indexing           | Mapping drift, partial load   | Index count, mapping, query tests   |
| Workflow orchestration| Failed retries, dependency order | DAG execution tests             |
| Performance           | Long shuffle, ES bulk lag     | Load and throughput tests           |
| Recovery              | Partial commit                | Idempotency and rollback tests      |

Each risk area should have targeted test cases to ensure reliability and correctness.


**2. Define Multi-Layer Test Types**

Design tests in layers, each with a clear scope, automation level, and ownership.

**Test Types Matrix**

| Test Type                | Goal                                                        | Key Coverage Areas                          | Owner           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Unit Tests               | Validate correctness of individual code functions           | Business logic, data parsing, mapping       | Data Engineers  |
| Component Tests          | Verify ETL modules work with real/synthetic inputs          | Loader jobs, validation scripts, calculators| Data Engineers  |
| Integration Tests        | Validate data and workflow across multiple components       | Databricks jobs, ES indexing, validation    | QA / SRE        |
| End-to-End Tests         | Validate full pipeline from source to final output          | Baseline & incremental runs, ES load        | QA / Data Eng   |
| Regression Tests         | Ensure changes don’t break previous results                 | Output diffs, checksums, metrics comparison | QA              |
| Performance Tests        | Verify speed, throughput, and scalability                   | Job duration, shuffle, ES indexing rate     | SRE / Data Eng  |
| Resilience / Chaos Tests | Confirm system handles failures gracefully                  | Job crashes, ES outages, recovery           | SRE             |
| Security / Compliance    | Validate access, masking, and encryption                    | PII masking, RBAC, audit logs               | Security Team   |


**3. Use a Risk-Based Test Coverage Model**

For each component or process:
- Assign a risk rating (High / Medium / Low) based on impact × likelihood.
- Focus automation and deeper test coverage on High-risk items:
    - Schema evolution / drift
    - Incremental delta logic
    - ES mapping compatibility
    - Cross-entity joins (author → article)
    - Large data performance
    - Validation/alerting reliability
- Medium and low risks can be handled via sampling, monitoring, or periodic manual checks.


**4. Define Entry & Exit Criteria per Test Level**

| Test Level    | Entry Criteria                              | Exit Criteria                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Unit          | Code reviewed, function logic stable         | ≥90% logic coverage, all assertions pass      |
| Component     | Job runs standalone                         | All module inputs/outputs verified            |
| Integration   | Environment & dependencies ready             | No schema or consistency errors               |
| End-to-End    | Full data path configured                    | All phases pass, output parity validated      |
| Performance   | Load environment ready                       | SLA met, no bottlenecks                      |
| Regression    | Golden dataset established                   | No unexpected diffs beyond tolerance          |


**5. Design Test Data Strategy**

- Build golden datasets for both baseline and incremental runs with known outcomes.
- Include edge cases (nulls, schema drift, duplicates, deletions).
- Partition test datasets to mimic production scale and variety.
- Store test data and expectations in version control for reproducibility.

**6. Automate Validation & Monitoring**

Use tools or frameworks to make validations reproducible and continuous:

- Great Expectations / Deequ / dbt tests for data quality and rule validation.
- pytest-spark for transformation logic.
- Databricks Jobs + Airflow for orchestrating test runs.
- Elasticsearch client tests for mapping and count verification.
- Slack/SNS alerts for failed tests or data drift.

**7. Ensure Observability in Test Design**

Each test should produce metrics and logs:

- Duration, throughput, error rates.
- Record counts, validation pass/fail metrics.
- Comparison dashboards for output differences.

These become the backbone of continuous data quality monitoring post-deployment.

**8. Iterate and Continuously Improve**

- Periodically reassess test types and priorities as the system evolves.
- Add new tests when:
    - Schema or process changes occur.
    - New entities or metrics are added.
    - New failure modes are observed in production.
- Retire redundant or low-value tests to keep the suite efficient.


#### ✅ Expected Outcome

A systematic, layered, automated test strategy that:

- Detects data integrity or processing errors early.
- Prevents silent data loss or metric corruption.
- Ensures all core processes (incremental, validation, ES load) are robust, scalable, and observable.
- Builds team confidence in daily automated delivery.

Would you like me to extend this into a “Test Strategy Blueprint” document (with sections like Scope, Risks, Coverage Matrix, Tooling, and Automation Framework)?
That version is ideal for onboarding QA/DevOps teams or audits.

###  End-to-End Test Strategy & Types Design


**🎯 Goal**

To design a comprehensive yet efficient testing strategy that ensures all critical components, data flows, and automation processes in the end-to-end system work correctly, reliably, and consistently — from input (Databricks) to output (Elasticsearch).

The goal is to detect and prevent system, data, and process issues early, validate that all integrations and workflows perform as expected, and confirm that the platform delivers accurate, timely, and stable results under real operational conditions.


**🧭 Methodology (How to Design the Strategy)**

1. Identify Critical Paths
   - Focus on core data flows — ingestion → processing → validation → output → load → ES → consumption.

2. Map System Interfaces & Dependencies
   - Document all key integrations (e.g., Databricks schemas, APIs, loaders, validation layers, ES cluster).

3. Define Test Types by Risk Area
    - Data Validation Tests – Schema, count, duplicates, referential integrity.
    - Workflow & Process Tests – Job orchestration, scheduling, dependencies, error handling.
    - Integration Tests – Cross-system data handoffs, API or connector reliability.
    - Performance Tests – Throughput, latency, scaling with volume.
    - Failure & Recovery Tests – Retry logic, checkpointing, recovery from interruption.
    - Regression & Consistency Tests – Compare new vs. baseline results for stability.

4. Use Layered Testing Approach
- Combine unit, component, integration, and end-to-end testing to cover both depth (details) and breadth (system-wide reliability).

5. Automate & Monitor Continuously
- Automate key scenarios for daily or CI/CD runs with alerts on critical failures or data anomalies.

####✅ Outcome

A structured, risk-based testing framework that ensures:

- All critical system and data processes are validated end-to-end
- Issues are caught early and reliably
- The platform operates with accuracy, stability, and resilience
