### ‚úÖ Tips for Tackling System Design Interviews

	1.	Clarify requirements: Functional vs non-functional (latency, availability, throughput).
	2.	Estimate scale: Users, requests per second, data size.
	3.	Start high-level: Draw architecture first (load balancer, DB, cache, API).
	4.	Dive deeper: Database schema, caching strategy, message queues, replication.
	5.	Discuss trade-offs: SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability, vertical vs horizontal scaling.
	6.	Prepare to iterate: Interviewers like seeing multiple options and reasoning.
