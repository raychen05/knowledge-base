## ✅ Stable Code Review Mechanism: Best Practices & Guidelines

Here is a complete Best Practices & Guideline for a Stable Code Review Mechanism, tailored to ensure high-quality code, encourage cross-team awareness, and promote peer learning.

---


### 🎯 Objective

Ensure consistent code quality, increase shared understanding, and grow engineering talent through effective and scalable peer reviews.

---

### 📘 SECTION 1: Code Review Philosophy

“The goal is not just to catch bugs—but to build understanding, share ownership, and grow each other.”

- 	Reviews are collaborative, not confrontational.
- 	Emphasize teaching, curiosity, and clarity over nitpicking.
- 	Everyone is both a learner and contributor, regardless of level.

### 🔍 SECTION 2: What to Check in a Code Review

| **Category**            | **What to Look For**                                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Correctness**       | Does the code do what it’s intended to? Any bugs or edge cases missed?     |
| ✅ **Readability**       | Is the logic easy to follow? Are names meaningful? Can someone unfamiliar pick it up? |
| ✅ **Test Coverage**     | Are there unit/integration tests? Are important branches covered?         |
| ✅ **Performance & Scalability** | Are there unnecessary loops, blocking calls, or large payloads?   |
| ✅ **Security & Safety** | Any unsafe inputs, missing validation, or access risks?                   |
| ✅ **Documentation**     | Are public methods and complex sections commented? README updated if needed? |
| ✅ **Consistency & Style** | Does it follow team coding standards and formatting tools (e.g. Prettier, Black)? |

### 📋 SECTION 3: Code Review Process Guidelines

1. Before Submitting a PR
- 	✅ Run all tests and linters.
- 	✅ Provide a clear PR title and description: what it does, why it matters, and how to test it.
- 	✅ Tag the right reviewers, based on code ownership and rotation.

2. During Review
- 	✅ Reviewers should respond within 24 hours (except weekends).
- 	✅ Use comments that teach, not just point out:
```txt
“Consider splitting this function for clarity.”
“This edge case might break if input is null—maybe add a check?”
```
- 	✅ Use suggestions feature (GitHub) for clear alternatives.
- 	✅ For major design shifts, ask for a short synchronous review or walk-through.

3. Post Review
- 	✅ PR authors should respond to every comment—either apply, clarify, or explain.
- 	✅ Once approved and CI passes, merge promptly to reduce drift.
- 	✅ If multiple approvals are required (e.g., critical components), enforce with rules.

---

### 🔁 SECTION 4: Rotation & Cross-Review

✅ Weekly Rotation of Primary Reviewers
- 	Assign “Lead Reviewer” per sprint (for core modules)
- 	Maintain a simple rotation board (in Notion/Spreadsheet)
- 	Encourage cross-domain reviews to avoid silos

✅ Pair Reviewing for Growth
- 	Junior engineers should review with a buddy for complex changes
- 	Host live review sessions occasionally: screen share & explain

### 🛠️ SECTION 5: Tools & Templates

```txt
GitHub PR Template (Sample)

### What Changed
Brief summary of code changes.

### Why This Matters
Explain the context or problem being solved.

### How to Test
Steps, environment, or command to verify.

### Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New code covered by tests
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
```

### 📈 SECTION 7: Continuous Improvement Practices

- 	Hold a “Code Review Retrospective” quarterly
Discuss: Are reviews useful? Too slow? Are we learning?
- 	Encourage “Review Stars” every month:
Acknowledge great teaching moments in PRs.
- 	Maintain a shared list of “Best Reviewed PRs” as learning examples
