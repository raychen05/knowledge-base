### Question    Annual Performance Goals

### Manager

#### Answer
As always, Ray played a critical role over the past year in nearly all major team responsibilities, particularly in WoS Research Intelligence, including AskRI. His insights and extensive experience with InCites and the WoS product family—in areas such as content, processes, and essential functionalities—were instrumental in helping the team and the company make critical decisions with significant strategic impact.


For example, his idea of using Delta Lake as the foundation for the new content delivery architecture led to the concept of a unified platform. This platform enables all teams responsible for various stages of content preparation to share the same infrastructure and collaborate more effectively. It eliminated previous boundaries among teams and integrated previously discrete, product-specific systems into a single platform managed through shared policies and governance.


Ray's exceptional ability to apply the right technology to solve complex business and technical challenges makes him an outstanding technologist. The team depends heavily on his expertise to address a wide range of technological challenges.
