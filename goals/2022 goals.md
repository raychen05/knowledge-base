- Comment

It has been a demanding year due to significant turnover among team members, including shifts in product managers. As the principal search engineer, I've taken on additional responsibilities beyond my core work and technical oversight of the offshore team. I've dedicated myself to offering comprehensive technical guidance to new members across various teams like product, IMS, and application teams. My aim has been to swiftly familiarize them with the business logic implementation, aiding in their efficient and accurate code development. Despite these challenges, our team has consistently achieved reliable and punctual deliveries while upholding exceptionally high data quality standards. Notably, we've successfully ensured the absence of any major data issues in the 2023 Incites data release.
