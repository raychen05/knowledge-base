## Model Context Protocol (MCP)


Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication protocol that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI systems to interact more effectively with external tools, data sources, APIs, memory systems, or other models by passing structured context or metadata during interaction. MCP is designed to standardize how models access and use contextual information, making multi-agent systems, tool-augmented models, and memory-augmented models more efficient and interoperable.

💡 Real-World Use Case: RAG-Powered Customer Support Agent


🧩 Scenario

A company wants an intelligent support chatbot that answers user queries using both general model knowledge and specific internal documents (FAQs, product manuals, support logs).

🔧 Implementation with MCP

1.	Document Indexing: All support docs are embedded into a vector DB.
2.	Query Handling:
    - User sends a question.
    - Query is embedded and matched against top-k documents.
3.	Context Injection via MCP:


```json
{
  "user_query": "How do I reset my device?",
  "retrieved_docs": ["Doc1 content...", "Doc2 content..."],
  "user_profile": {
    "user_id": "u123",
    "device_model": "X100",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "task_type": "support_response",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```



4.	Model Response: LLM uses this MCP-formatted context to answer accurately.

✅ Benefits
	- Accurate Answers: Grounded in real documents.
	- Personalized: Tailored to user’s device and language.
	- Efficient: Reusable interface between components.

🔍 Use Case Overview:

“Context-Aware Article Summary Assistant using MCP”

✅ Goals
	1.	Summarize topics from search result articles.
	2.	Validate alignment with the user’s original search intent.
	3.	Enable follow-up Q&A based on that filtered subset.


🧠 MCP Features Used in This Use Case
