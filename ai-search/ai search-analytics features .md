### ✅ 2. Building Your Own LLM-Powered Article Search Assistant



Here’s how you could build a custom solution like this, using LLMs + semantic search + summarization pipelines:

### 🧱 Architecture Overview

```text
User Query
   ↓
[Semantic Search Engine] ←→ [Scientific Paper Index]
   ↓
[Context Assembler (MCP format)]
   ↓
[LLM Agent (Summarizer + Intent Matcher)]
   ↓
[Relevant Paper Summary + Follow-up Q&A Handler]
```

---

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation


🔍 1. Search & Index Layer

	- Options: ElasticSearch + BM25/Sparse/Dense embeddings (e.g., using SciBERT, OpenAI Embeddings, etc.)
	- Index Source: ArXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar APIs, or your own database.

```python
# Semantic Search using OpenAI or HuggingFace embeddings
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
model = SentenceTransformer("allenai-specter")  # Designed for scientific papers
query_embed = model.encode("climate change impact on agriculture", convert_to_tensor=True)
top_k_papers = util.semantic_search(query_embed, indexed_embeddings, top_k=10)
```

---

🧠 2. Context Packager (Model Context Protocol style)

Create a compact context object from top papers:

```json
{
  "query": "climate change impact on agriculture",
  "articles": [
    { "title": "...", "abstract": "...", "keywords": ["drought", "yield"] },
    ...
  ],
  "task": "summarize + intent match",
  "follow_up": null
}
```

---

🤖 3. LLM-Based Summary & Relevance Evaluation

Prompt template:

```text
“Given the following articles and user query, summarize the main topics and assess if they align with the user’s search intent. Also suggest which articles are most relevant.”
```

Feed it to an LLM like GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, etc.


💬 4. Follow-up Question Support

Store all retrieved articles in vector store or structured cache (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate), and let users ask:

“Which crops are most affected?”

Use the same article set + context + LLM to answer without re-searching.

Accurately understanding user search intent and interest is key to making scientific paper search truly smart. Here’s a breakdown of how to use LLMs effectively to analyze a user’s input query and extract intent, topic focus, and even implicit needs (e.g., methods, comparisons, or desired outcomes).

## ✅ Goal: Use LLM to turn a fuzzy user query into structured search intent



###  🧠 1. What is “Search Intent” in Research Context?

In scientific search, “intent” goes beyond just keywords:


| **Intent Type**            | **Example**                                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 Topic discovery          | “Recent trends in AI drug discovery”                            |
| ⚖️ Comparison               | “Compare effectiveness of mRNA vs viral vector vaccines”        |
| 📚 Metric evaluation        | “Citations of CRISPR papers since 2020”                         |
| 🧪 Method-focused           | “Papers using GANs for image segmentation”                      |
| 🎯 Specific result          | “Success rate of gene editing in agriculture”                   |
| 🧑‍🏫 Entity-specific        | “Stanford’s work on climate models”                              |

### 🧭 2. Best Approach Using LLMs


🎯 LLM Prompt Strategy — Step-by-step:

🔹 Step 1: Capture user query and context

```json
{
  "query": "Impact of AI on radiology diagnosis accuracy",
  "user_profile": {
    "role": "clinical researcher",
    "interest": "applications of AI in healthcare"
  }
}
```

---

🔹 Step 2: Prompt LLM to extract search intent

```plaintext
You are a research assistant.

Given this user query: "Impact of AI on radiology diagnosis accuracy"

Extract:
1. Main topics
2. Field of study
3. Type of desired results (e.g., trends, metrics, comparisons, methods)
4. Related keywords or synonyms
5. Potential paper filtering strategies (e.g., after 2019, clinical trials)

Respond in structured JSON.
```


🔹 LLM Output:

```json
{
  "main_topics": ["AI in radiology", "diagnostic accuracy"],
  "field_of_study": "medical imaging, artificial intelligence",
  "desired_result_type": "impact analysis, performance metrics",
  "related_keywords": ["deep learning", "radiological diagnosis", "AI-assisted imaging"],
  "filters": {
    "year": ">=2019",
    "study_type": ["clinical study", "systematic review"]
  }
}
```

🛠️ 3. Implementation Tips


| **Action**                                    | **Description**                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Use LLM as a preprocessor                  | Run the intent-extraction before semantic search or retrieval.        |
| ✅ Structure it as function-calling or JSON extraction | So you can use outputs programmatically in search.                    |
| ✅ Chain with retrieval filters               | Feed LLM output to a semantic search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, FAISS) as filters or expansion terms. |
| ✅ Support follow-up questions                | Retain initial intent context and add user clarifications to refine results. |
| ✅ Use user persona if available              | Domain knowledge helps steer LLM answers better (e.g., “AI researcher” vs. “clinician”). |

### 🧪 Bonus: Prompt Templates You Can Use

🎓 Research Query Analyzer

```plaintext
You are a scientific assistant. Given a user query, analyze it and output:

- Intent type (exploratory, comparative, quantitative, etc.)
- Core subjects
- Key metrics or outcomes
- Suggested synonyms or expanded terms
- Recommended filters (years, fields, etc.)
```


### ✅ Benefits of This Approach


| **Feature**               | **Why it Helps**                                                            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 Better intent targeting | Ensures user gets articles relevant to their actual question, not just keywords |
| 🧩 Improved query expansion| Adds missing terms (e.g., “deep learning” for “AI”)                           |
| 🔍 Smart filtering         | Applies smart constraints like year ranges or paper types                    |
| 🔄 Dynamic follow-up       | Keeps search results aligned as user asks follow-up questions               |



### 🚀 Want Help Setting This Up?

I can provide:
- 	A LangChain or Python script for intent extraction + query construction
- 	A search flow diagram
- 	Sample code that chains user intent → semantic search → LLM summary
