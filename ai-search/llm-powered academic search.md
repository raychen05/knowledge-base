### üß† 2. LLM Prompt Template: Intent Understanding

Use this when the user types in a few keywords or a short query.


Prompt
```text
You are an academic research assistant. A user entered the following query:

Infer the following:
- Research topic / domain
- Likely intent (background info, method comparison, emerging research, etc.)
- Suggested subtopics or related areas
- Possible filters (year, field, funding, institution, etc.)
- Related research questions they may want to explore

```

Sample Output:

```yaml

### üìà 5. Smart Drill-Down Prompts (LLM-powered)


These guide the user after viewing results:

Prompt

```text
Based on the current search for "green hydrogen electrolysis", suggest 3 follow-up queries the user might be interested in. Include one that focuses on innovation (patents), one on funding, and one that broadens the scope.

```

Output Example:

- Innovation-focused: ‚ÄúPatents related to catalysts in hydrogen electrolysis‚Äù
- Funding-focused: ‚ÄúEU-funded projects on hydrogen production (2020‚Äì2024)‚Äù
- Broader: ‚ÄúClean hydrogen production methods compared‚Äù

model = SentenceTransformer("allenai-specter")
query_embedding = model.encode("Impact of AI on radiology accuracy", convert_to_tensor=True)

# Assume `doc_embeddings` is a FAISS index with paper vectors
D, I = doc_index.search(query_embedding.cpu().numpy(), top_k=10)
top_papers = [doc_metadata[i] for i in I[0]]

```


With Expanded Query (LLM Output)

You can combine:

2. Identify how well these align with the user‚Äôs search intent.
3. Highlight the most relevant papers and why.

Respond with structured summary and ranked list.

```

Output Sample

```json
{
  "summary": "The papers explore AI models improving radiology accuracy, especially deep learning in cancer detection.",
  "alignment": "High ‚Äì Most papers evaluate diagnostic performance.",
  "top_recommendations": [
    {"title": "...", "reason": "Direct comparison of AI vs human diagnosis"},

### üí¨ 5. Follow-up Question Handler

Setup:
- 	Store the top article texts + metadata.
- 	Use LLM with retrieval context (e.g., LangChain‚Äôs ConversationalRetrievalChain).

Sample Follow-up Q:

### üíª 6. Starter Code with LangChain (LLM + Retrieval + QA)

Install LangChain & FAISS
```bash
pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu

```

Code Snippet

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Embedding + FAISS
embed = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(paper_abstracts, embed)

# QA chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(),
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

response = qa_chain.run("What are the top AI methods used in radiology?")

üå± Innovation Tip:

Add a ‚ÄúResearch Companion‚Äù mode, where the LLM not only fetches papers, but also:

- Summarizes research trends,
- Compares methods,
- Tracks what's emerging,
- Recommends grants/patents to explore,
- Answers domain-specific follow-ups using the retrieved articles.
