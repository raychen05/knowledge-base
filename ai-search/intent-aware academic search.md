## A Amart, Intent-aware Academic Search Experience

You're asking a powerful and important question — how to use AI, especially large language models (LLMs), to create a smart, intent-aware academic search experience that not only retrieves highly relevant articles but also presents multiple useful research angles (emerging trends, grants, patents, related work, etc.) for exploration and innovation.

Here’s a systematic, innovation-driven approach for designing such a solution:

### 🔍 1. Understand User Intent Using LLMs


✅ Goal:

Translate a few user-entered keywords into a rich, contextual understanding of their true research intent.

💡 Techniques:

- LLM-based intent classification
→ Classify the query into research types (e.g., background, method search, emerging area, application-specific).

- Semantic enrichment
→ Expand the keywords into a semantic profile: related terms, synonyms, subtopics, broader contexts.

- Prompt-based intent inference
→ Prompt an LLM with:
"Given this search query: 'green hydrogen electrolysis', what is the likely research intent, scope, and related concepts?"

- Auto-detect granularity & scope
→ Is the user looking for a broad survey, a specific method, latest breakthroughs, etc.?


---

### 🧠 2. Match Semantically Relevant Articles (Not Just Keyword Search)


✅ Goal:

Go beyond keywords—use semantic embeddings and LLM-generated relevance scoring.

💡 Techniques:

- Embed query & documents (using models like OpenAI, Cohere, or SciBERT) and retrieve via vector search (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).

- LLM reranking
→ Use an LLM to re-rank top N results based on inferred user intent.

- Highlight match reasoning
→ Ask the LLM: “Why is this article relevant to the query intent?” and show that to the user.


---

### 📊 3. Provide a Multi-Angle View of Results


✅ Goal:

Give users different lenses to explore—think faceted exploration with intelligence.

💡 Views:

- By Research Type: Reviews, Original Research, Case Studies, etc.
- By Impact: Highly cited, recent, emerging, disruptive.
- By Funding: Articles linked to funded projects (grants, funders).
- By Innovation: Patents citing or cited by the article.
- By Collaboration: Institutions, authorship networks.
- By Methodology: ML-based, clinical trial, qualitative, etc.
- By Application Domain: Medicine, energy, education, policy, etc.

---

### 🔎 4. Enable Smart Drill-Down and Exploration

✅ Goal:

Let users zoom in or expand scope intelligently based on what they see.

💡 Features:

- Smart filters: Auto-suggest filters based on query and top results.
- LLM-assisted facet summarization
→ e.g., “What are the key subtopics in the results?”
- Related Questions / Follow-ups
→ Auto-generated by LLM: “Want to explore recent grants in this area?”

---

### 🚀 5. Feedback Loop & Personalization

✅ Goal:

Learn from user behavior and refine future searches.

💡 Techniques:

- Implicit feedback (clicks, saves, drill-downs)
- Query reformulation suggestions
- “Research Pathway” builder
→ Track steps, allow saving and reloading workflows.

🌱 Innovation Tip:

Add a “Research Companion” mode, where the LLM not only fetches papers, but also:

- Summarizes research trends,
- Compares methods,
- Tracks what's emerging,
- Recommends grants/patents to explore,
- Answers domain-specific follow-ups using the retrieved articles.
