## Find Emerging Research Topics


To find emerging research topics in your field and high-quality articles representing recent advances using Web of Science (WoS), follow this structured approach:


### Step 1: Identify Emerging Research Topics


**Method 1**: Use “Hot Papers” and “Highly Cited Papers”

1.	Go to Web of Science and navigate to the Essential Science Indicators (ESI).
2.	Click on Highly Cited Papers and Hot Papers in your research field.
3.	Filter by your discipline (e.g., “Computer Science”, “Biomedical Research”, “Physics”).
4.	Look for repeated themes, new methodologies, or interdisciplinary research areas.


**Method 2**: Use “Research Fronts” for Trend Analysis

1.	Visit InCites Journal Citation Reports (JCR) or the ESI Research Fronts feature.
2.	Identify clusters of articles citing each other on new or rapidly growing topics.
3.	Search for terms like “emerging”, “novel”, “future directions”, “breakthrough”.


**Method 3:** Perform Advanced Keyword Searches

-	Use WoS’s Advanced Search with Boolean operators:
```plaintext
("emerging research" OR "future trends" OR "novel approach") AND "your field"
