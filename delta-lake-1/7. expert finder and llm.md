### 🔹 Expert Scoring Model for Identifying Top Researchers

To systematically rank experts in a specific research area, we can use a multi-factor scoring model with a weighted scoring system. Below is a structured framework for scoring researchers based on their publications, impact, patents, grants, and collaborations.


---

#### 🔹 Step 1: Define the Scoring Criteria and Weights

Each expert will be scored across multiple dimensions. Below is a proposed weight distribution (weights can be adjusted based on research priorities).


| **Category**               | **Criteria**                           | **Weight (%)** | **Score Calculation Method**                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 📚 **Research Output**      | Number of Publications (last 5 years)  | 10%            | Percentile ranking (Z-score)                      |
|                            | H-index                                | 10%            | Normalized percentile                              |
|                            | Total Citations                        | 10%            | Log-transformed score                             |
| 🔥 **Research Impact**      | Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI)  | 10%            | FWCI > 1 means above average                       |
|                            | Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of Top Papers | 5%           | Average JIF of top 5 papers                       |
| 🚀 **Innovation (Patents)** | Number of Patents                      | 10%            | Percentile ranking                                |
|                            | Patent Citations                       | 5%             | Normalized percentile                              |
| 💰 **Research Funding**     | Total Grant Amount Secured             | 10%            | Log-transformed score                             |
|                            | Number of Grants Secured               | 5%             | Normalized percentile                              |
| 🤝 **Collaboration Strength**| Co-authorship Network Size            | 5%             | Number of unique co-authors                        |
|                            | International Collaborations           | 5%             | % of co-authors from different countries          |
| 🏆 **Academic Leadership**  | Editorial Board Memberships            | 5%             | Binary scoring (Yes/No)                           |
|                            | Keynote/Invited Talks at Major Conferences | 5%           | Count of major invitations                        |
| 🎓 **Mentorship**           | PhD Students Supervised                | 5%             | Number of successful PhDs supervised               |


Total Score = Weighted sum of all category scores


---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Normalize and Compute Scores

To ensure fairness, each metric should be normalized to avoid scale differences. Some standard normalization techniques include:

1.	Min-Max Scaling (for values that have a clear range, e.g., percentage of international co-authors)

\text{Normalized Score} = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}

2.	Log Transformation (for highly skewed data like citations and funding amounts)

\text{Score} = \log(1 + X)

3.	Percentile Ranking (for ranking-based metrics like H-index, publication count, and patents)

\text{Percentile Score} = \frac{\text{Rank of Expert}}{\text{Total Experts}} \times 100

4.	Binary Scoring (for yes/no metrics like editorial board memberships)
-	1 if the researcher meets the criteria
-	0 if not
    
---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Ranking and Filtering Experts

-	Compute the overall expert score based on the weighted sum of all criteria.
-	Apply field-specific thresholds (e.g., only consider researchers with an H-index > 20 or FWCI > 1.5).
-	Use subject area filters (e.g., only include researchers in AI, physics, or medicine).
-	Rank experts in descending order by their total score.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Implementation in SQL / Spark

If your data is stored in Databricks / Delta Lake, you can compute scores using SQL or PySpark.

SQL Example (Databricks)
```sql
SELECT 
    researcher_id,
    topic,
    (pub_count * 0.10) + 
    (log(h_index + 1) * 0.10) + 
    (log(total_citations + 1) * 0.10) + 
    (fwci * 10) + 
    (log(grant_amount + 1) * 0.10) +
    (patent_count * 0.10) +
    (log(patent_citations + 1) * 0.05) +
    (international_collaboration_ratio * 5) +
    (editorial_board_membership * 5) +
    (keynote_invites * 5)
    AS expert_score
FROM researcher_metrics
WHERE topic IN ('Artificial Intelligence', 'Quantum Computing')
ORDER BY expert_score DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

PySpark Example (Databricks)
```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

df = df.withColumn("log_h_index", F.log1p("h_index")) \
       .withColumn("log_total_citations", F.log1p("total_citations")) \
       .withColumn("log_grant_amount", F.log1p("grant_amount")) \
       .withColumn("log_patent_citations", F.log1p("patent_citations"))

df = df.withColumn("expert_score", 
       0.10 * df["pub_count"] +
       0.10 * df["log_h_index"] +
       0.10 * df["log_total_citations"] +
       10 * df["fwci"] +
       0.10 * df["log_grant_amount"] +
       0.10 * df["patent_count"] +
       0.05 * df["log_patent_citations"] +
       5 * df["international_collaboration_ratio"] +
       5 * df["editorial_board_membership"] +
       5 * df["keynote_invites"])

df.orderBy(F.desc("expert_score")).show(50)
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: Enhancing the Ranking Model

-	Custom Weights: Adjust weights for different domains (e.g., patents matter more in engineering, while citations matter more in medicine).
-	Machine Learning: Use Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to predict top experts based on past trends.
-	Graph Analysis: Identify highly connected researchers in citation networks using PageRank.

    
---

#### 🔹 Summary

1.	Define Criteria → Publications, citations, patents, funding, leadership, etc.
2.	Normalize Scores → Use log scaling, percentiles, and min-max normalization.
3.	Compute Overall Score → Use weighted aggregation.
4.	Rank Experts → Order by total expert score.
5.	Filter for Domain-Specific Needs → Customize thresholds based on field relevance.

##  Using LLMs for Expert Finder Based on Custom Requirements

Instead of hardcoding weights for different metrics, we can use an LLM to evaluate researcher profiles dynamically based on the user’s requirements. The LLM can understand natural language queries and prioritize experts accordingly.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Preparing Data for LLM Input

Before passing data to the LLM, we need to structure each researcher’s profile in a concise and structured format.

Example of Researcher Profile (JSON format)
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. Alice Johnson",
  "affiliation": "Harvard University",
  "primary_research_areas": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning"],
  "publications": 120,
  "h_index": 42,
  "citations": 18,400,
  "fwci": 2.3,
  "patents": 4,
  "grant_funding": 4.5,
  "international_collaborations": 60,
  "editorial_board_membership": true,
  "invited_talks": 15,
  "mentorships": 12
}
```

-	Publications: Number of research papers
-	H-index: Impact of research work
-	Citations: Total citation count
-	FWCI (Field-Weighted Citation Impact): Research impact relative to the field
-	Patents: Number of patents held
-	Grant Funding: Total research funding (in million USD)
-	International Collaborations: % of international co-authors
-	Editorial Board Membership: Leadership in journals
-	Invited Talks: Recognized expert status
-	Mentorships: Number of PhD students supervised


---

### 🔹 Step 2: Designing an LLM Prompt to Find the Best Expert

The prompt should be designed to interpret user preferences and prioritize experts dynamically.

Example LLM Prompt
```plaintext
You are an expert finder system that identifies the best researchers in a given field.  

I will provide a JSON array of researchers, including their publication count, H-index, citations, patents, grant funding, and other academic metrics.

### Task:  
1. Analyze the given researcher profiles.
2. Rank the top experts based on the user's priorities.
3. Provide an explanation for why each expert is selected.

### User Requirements:
{user_query}

### Researcher Data:
{researcher_profiles_json}

### Output Format:
{
  "top_experts": [
    {
      "name": "Best Researcher Name",
      "affiliation": "Institution",
      "reason": "Explain why this researcher is ranked highly based on the user's preferences."
    },
    {
      "name": "Second Best Researcher Name",
      "affiliation": "Institution",
      "reason": "Explain why this researcher is ranked highly."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Example User Queries


Users can input custom requirements to prioritize different factors.

Example 1: Prioritize Impact and Citations

```json
{
  "priority": "Find the top researchers in Artificial Intelligence who have high citations and impact. Prioritize those with FWCI above 2.0 and an H-index above 40."
}
```

-	LLM Output: Experts ranked by citations, FWCI, and H-index.

Example 2: Prioritize Innovation (Patents + Funding)
```json
{
  "priority": "Find top researchers in Bioengineering who have the most patents and research funding. Prioritize those with at least 5 patents and more than $5M in grants."
}
```json

-	LLM Output: Experts ranked by patents and funding.


Example 3: Prefer International Collaborators
```json
{
  "priority": "Find top researchers in Climate Science who collaborate internationally and publish in high-impact journals."
}
```

-	LLM Output: Experts ranked by international collaborations and journal impact.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Running the LLM in Python

You can use OpenAI’s GPT API or a similar LLM in Databricks to evaluate researchers.

Example Python Code
```python
import openai
import json

# User query
user_query = {
    "priority": "Find top AI researchers with high citation impact and at least 10 invited talks."
}

# Researcher dataset
researchers = [
    {
        "name": "Dr. Alice Johnson",
        "affiliation": "Harvard University",
        "primary_research_areas": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning"],
        "publications": 120,
        "h_index": 42,
        "citations": 18400,
        "fwci": 2.3,
        "patents": 4,
        "grant_funding": 4.5,
        "international_collaborations": 60,
        "editorial_board_membership": True,
        "invited_talks": 15,
        "mentorships": 12
    },
    {
        "name": "Dr. Bob Smith",
        "affiliation": "MIT",
        "primary_research_areas": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Deep Learning"],
        "publications": 95,
        "h_index": 38,
        "citations": 14500,
        "fwci": 2.1,
        "patents": 2,
        "grant_funding": 3.2,
        "international_collaborations": 50,
        "editorial_board_membership": False,
        "invited_talks": 9,
        "mentorships": 8
    }
]

# Define prompt
prompt = f"""
You are an expert finder system that identifies the best researchers in a given field.

I will provide a JSON array of researchers, including their publication count, H-index, citations, patents, grant funding, and other academic metrics.

### Task:
1. Analyze the given researcher profiles.
2. Rank the top experts based on the user's priorities.
3. Provide an explanation for why each expert is selected.

### User Requirements:
{json.dumps(user_query)}

### Researcher Data:
{json.dumps(researchers)}

### Output Format:
{{
  "top_experts": [
    {{
      "name": "Best Researcher Name",
      "affiliation": "Institution",
      "reason": "Explain why this researcher is ranked highly based on the user's preferences."
    }}
  ]
}}
"""

# Call OpenAI API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a research expert ranking assistant."},
              {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

# Extract response
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

---

### 🔹 Benefits of Using LLM for Expert Ranking

1.	Dynamic Prioritization → Users can change requirements, and LLM adapts.

---

### 🔹 Conclusion

-	Instead of hardcoding an expert ranking system, we can use LLMs to interpret user needs dynamically.
-	This allows flexibility, letting different users prioritize citations, patents, collaborations, funding, or any other metric.
-	By providing structured researcher data as input, the LLM can find the best experts based on the user’s needs in real-time.

---

## 🔹 Integrating Expert Finder into Databricks

To integrate this LLM-based expert ranking system into Databricks, we need to:

1.	Store & Load Researcher Data from Delta Lake
2.	Prepare the Data for LLM (convert to structured JSON)
3.	Send Query to LLM (OpenAI API or a self-hosted model)
4.	Rank Experts Dynamically based on the user’s preferences
5.	Return & Store Results for further analysis

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Storing Researcher Data in Delta Lake

We assume researcher profiles are stored in Delta Tables in Databricks Catalog.

Example Schema for Researcher Data Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE incites.researchers (
    researcher_id STRING,
    name STRING,
    affiliation STRING,
    primary_research_areas ARRAY<STRING>,
    publications INT,
    h_index INT,
    citations INT,
    fwci DOUBLE,
    patents INT,
    grant_funding DOUBLE,
    international_collaborations INT,
    editorial_board_membership BOOLEAN,
    invited_talks INT,
    mentorships INT
) USING DELTA;
```

This schema stores all relevant research metrics.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Query Researcher Data in PySpark

We extract relevant researchers based on the user’s custom query.

Python Code to Query Delta Table in Databricks
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import json

# Initialize Spark session in Databricks
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ExpertFinder").getOrCreate()

# User query (example: AI researchers with high impact)
user_query = {
    "priority": "Find AI researchers with high citations, patents, and international collaborations."
}

# Query Delta table for relevant researchers
df = spark.sql("""
    SELECT *
    FROM incites.researchers
    WHERE array_contains(primary_research_areas, 'Artificial Intelligence')
""")

# Convert to JSON format for LLM input
researchers_json = json.dumps(df.toPandas().to_dict(orient="records"), indent=2)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Sending Data to OpenAI LLM

Now, we send the structured researcher data to GPT-4 (or a local LLM).

Databricks Notebook Code to Call OpenAI API
```python
import openai

# Define the LLM prompt
prompt = f"""
You are an expert finder system that identifies top researchers based on user requirements.

### Task:
1. Analyze researcher profiles with metrics such as citations, patents, grant funding, and collaborations.
2. Rank them based on the user's priorities.
3. Provide an explanation for the ranking.

### User Requirements:
{json.dumps(user_query)}

### Researcher Data:
{researchers_json}

### Output Format:
{{
  "top_experts": [
    {{
      "name": "Best Researcher Name",
      "affiliation": "Institution",
      "reason": "Explain why this researcher is ranked highly."
    }}
  ]
}}
"""

# Call OpenAI API
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a research expert ranking assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
)

# Extract and print results
top_experts = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
print(top_experts)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Storing & Returning the Results

After ranking, we store the expert list in Delta Lake for further analysis.

Save Ranked Experts to Delta Table
```python
from pyspark.sql import Row

# Convert JSON response to DataFrame
experts_list = json.loads(top_experts)["top_experts"]
expert_rows = [Row(**expert) for expert in experts_list]
experts_df = spark.createDataFrame(expert_rows)

# Save results to Delta table
experts_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("incites.expert_recommendations")
```

---
### 🔹 Step 5: Building a User-Friendly Interface

To let users interactively find experts:

-	Use Databricks UI + Widgets for input.
-	Build an API endpoint using Databricks MLflow or Flask.
-	Integrate with Power BI / Streamlit for visualization.
