## Efficient Approach for Daily Batch Update to Delta Table

When doing a daily batch update to read data from S3 and update a Delta Table, the approach depends on your requirements and the scale of your data.

---

1. Regular Delta Table vs. Delta Live Table
   
| Aspect               | Regular Delta Table                                          | Delta Live Table (DLT)                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | General-purpose, suitable for batch and streaming.           | Optimized for data pipelines with automated lineage, quality checks, and monitoring. |
| **Performance Optimization** | Manual (optimize with OPTIMIZE, ZORDER, partitioning).   | Automated data quality checks, schema enforcement, and incremental processing. |
| **Use Case**         | Ideal for batch processing, especially when you need more control over optimization. | Ideal for complex pipelines requiring monitoring, auto-repair, and enhanced reliability. |
| **Scalability**      | High, but requires careful management of files and checkpoints. | High, with built-in handling of data integrity and schema changes. |
| **Triggering Workflows** | External triggers (Databricks Workflows, Airflow, etc.).    | Integrated triggering mechanisms, but can also be triggered via Workflows. |
| **Ease of Use**      | More flexibility, but manual management required.            | Easier to manage complex pipelines with simplified error handling. |
| **Cost**             | Generally lower if optimally managed.                        | May incur extra costs due to DLT features. |


Recommendation: For a daily batch update, a regular Delta Table is usually sufficient if you handle optimizations properly (like compaction, partitioning). However, if you need better monitoring, lineage tracking, and auto-healing, Delta Live Tables provide more robustness.

2. Efficient Approach

🔍 Reading Data Efficiently

Use spark.read with proper schema inference or predefined schema.

```scala
val df = spark.read
  .format("parquet")
  .load("s3://your-bucket/path/")
```


🔍 Processing Data Efficiently

Use MERGE for upserts (inserts, updates, deletes).

```scala
import io.delta.tables._
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "s3://your-bucket/delta-table-path/")

// Incoming data from S3
val incomingDF = spark.read
  .format("parquet")
  .load("s3://your-bucket/path/")

// Merge (Upsert) Operation
deltaTable.as("tgt")
  .merge(
    incomingDF.as("src"),
    "tgt.pguid = src.pguid"  // Match condition (Primary Key)
  )
  .whenMatched().updateAll()  // Update existing records
  .whenNotMatched().insertAll()  // Insert new records
  .execute()
```

🔍 Saving to Delta Table

```scala
incomingDF.write
  .format("delta")
  .mode("append")
  .save("s3://your-bucket/delta-table-path/")
```

🔍 Optimize Table (Recommended for Performance)

```scala
spark.sql("OPTIMIZE your_catalog.your_schema.your_table ZORDER BY (pguid)")
```

---

3. Triggering the Pipeline (Workflow Job)

Use Databricks Workflows for reliable scheduling.

📅 Recommended Approach

1.	Use Scheduled Trigger in Databricks Workflows (via UI or databricks-cli).
2.	Event-driven Triggering if new files arrive in S3 (can be implemented using AWS Lambda or Databricks Workflows with file detection).
3.	Incremental Processing: Use checkpointLocation to avoid reprocessing the same data.

```scala
.option("checkpointLocation", "s3://your-bucket/checkpoints/")
```

---


4. Best Practice Recommendation

1.	Use Regular Delta Table if:
- 	You need full control over performance optimizations (using OPTIMIZE, VACUUM).
- 	You don’t need automated monitoring or quality enforcement.
- 	You want to minimize cost.

2.	Use Delta Live Table if:
- 	You need built-in monitoring, lineage tracking, and automatic schema evolution.
- 	Your pipeline is complex and requires high reliability with auto-healing.

3.	Triggering via Databricks Workflows is preferred for robustness and scalability.
- 	Schedule the workflow to trigger daily.
- 	Use a separate job for each table if dependencies are independent.
- 	Use Task Dependencies for chaining jobs if needed.

## 🚀 Implementing a Complete Workflow Pipeline Using Databricks Workflows


We’ll build a workflow pipeline that:
- 	✅ Reads data from S3 location.
- 	✅ Updates data to Delta Table using MERGE.
- 	✅ Processes append, update, and delete operations.
- 	✅ Uses Checkpoints for fault tolerance and recovery.
- 	✅ Supports rollback and restart processing on failure.
- 	✅ Schedules using Databricks Workflows.

--- 

🔥 Workflow Design

1.	Ingest Data Job: Reads from S3 location and writes data to a raw Delta table.
2.	Process Updates Job: Processes incoming data with MERGE operation.
3.	Optimize Table Job: Optimizes the Delta Table for performance.
4.	Cleanup Job: Handles old files, checkpoints, or metadata cleanup.


---

📌 Step 1: Creating Tables

Raw Delta Table (Landing Table)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_catalog.your_schema.raw_table (
  pguid STRING,
  wos_count INT,
  tot_cites INT,
  grant_count INT,
  award_amount_usd DOUBLE,
  intl_collab_docs INT,
  max_year INT,
  min_year INT,
  hindex INT,
  highly_cited_docs INT,
  top_10_percent_docs INT,
  cites_from_patents INT
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/raw_table_path/';
```

Processed Delta Table (Main Table)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_catalog.your_schema.main_table (
  pguid STRING,
  wos_count INT,
  tot_cites INT,
  grant_count INT,
  award_amount_usd DOUBLE,
  intl_collab_docs INT,
  max_year INT,
  min_year INT,
  hindex INT,
  highly_cited_docs INT,
  top_10_percent_docs INT,
  cites_from_patents INT
)
USING DELTA
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/main_table_path/';
```

---

📌 Step 2: Ingest Data Job

```scala
val rawDF = spark.read
  .format("parquet")
  .load("s3://your-bucket/daily-data/")

rawDF.write
  .format("delta")
  .mode("append")
  .saveAsTable("your_catalog.your_schema.raw_table")
```

---

📌 Step 3: Process Updates Job

```scala
import io.delta.tables._
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "your_catalog.your_schema.main_table")
val incomingDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .table("your_catalog.your_schema.raw_table")

deltaTable.as("main")
  .merge(
    incomingDF.as("incoming"),
    "main.pguid = incoming.pguid"
  )
  .whenMatched().updateAll()
  .whenNotMatched().insertAll()
  .execute()

```

---

📌 Step 4: Optimize Table Job

```scala
spark.sql("OPTIMIZE your_catalog.your_schema.main_table ZORDER BY (pguid)")
```

---

📌 Step 5: Cleanup Job

```scala
spark.sql("VACUUM your_catalog.your_schema.main_table RETAIN 168 HOURS")  // Retains 7 days of history
```

---

📌 Step 6: Workflow Configuration in Databricks Workflows

1. Create a Workflow in Databricks UI
- 	Go to Workflows > Create Workflow.
- 	Give a meaningful name.

2. Define Jobs

Add jobs as separate tasks:

| Task Name          | Task Type | Notebook Path / JAR        | Dependencies     |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Ingest Data        | Notebook  | Ingest Data Notebook       | None             |
| Process Updates    | Notebook  | Process Updates Notebook   | Ingest Data      |
| Optimize Table     | Notebook  | Optimize Table Notebook    | Process Updates  |
| Cleanup            | Notebook  | Cleanup Notebook           | Optimize Table   |


3. Scheduling
- 	Set a Schedule for the Ingest Data Job (e.g., Daily at Midnight).
- 	Other jobs will be triggered via task dependencies.

4. Retry Policy & Error Handling
- 	Configure retries in each task (e.g., 3 retries).
- 	Enable Fail fast if required.

5. Checkpoints & Rollbacks

Use checkpoints for reliable processing:

```scala
val processedStream = incomingDF.writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "s3://your-bucket/checkpoints/")
  .start("s3://your-bucket/main_table_path/")
```

To rollback, use time travel:

```sql
RESTORE TABLE your_catalog.your_schema.main_table TO VERSION AS OF 42;
```

---

📌 Step 7: Restart Processing on Failure

If your job fails, you can restart it from the Databricks Workflow UI or CLI.

---

📌 Step 8: Fetch Latest Version of Update

Delta tables provide time-travel features:

```scala
val latestDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .table("your_catalog.your_schema.main_table")
```

---

💡 Best Practices

- 	🔥 Use Partitioning: Partition your tables by frequently queried columns (e.g., date).
- 	📈 Enable CDF (Change Data Feed): For incremental processing.
- 	📦 Use Workflows for Automation: Clearly define dependencies between tasks.
- 	📊 Optimize & Compact Data: Use OPTIMIZE and VACUUM regularly.
- 	📌 Use ZORDER Indexing: For faster queries, especially on frequently used columns.

## ✅ Configuring Checkpointing, Handling Failures, and Resuming Processing in Delta Lake (Batch Processing Pipeline)

When you implement a daily batch update pipeline using Delta Live Tables (DLT) or regular Delta tables, properly configuring checkpointing is essential to ensure resilience, especially when dealing with updates, inserts, and deletes.


📌 1. Setting Up Checkpointing in Your Batch Processing Pipeline

You should specify a unique checkpoint location for each job or table you are processing. This is typically done using .option("checkpointLocation", "path") in your write operation.

```scala
val deltaTablePath = "s3://your-bucket/delta-table-path"
val checkpointPath = "s3://your-bucket/checkpoints/daily-batch-update"

// Read the incoming data from S3 (e.g., in Parquet format)
val incomingDF = spark.read
  .format("parquet")
  .load("s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/")

// Perform your processing logic (e.g., transformations, filtering, etc.)
val processedDF = incomingDF
  .filter("some_filter_condition")
  .select("col1", "col2", "col3")

// Write processed data to the Delta table with checkpointing
processedDF.write
  .format("delta")
  .mode("append")
  .option("checkpointLocation", checkpointPath)
  .save(deltaTablePath)
```

---

📌 2. Handling Failures

To handle failures and ensure your pipeline can resume properly:

📂 Best Practices

1.	Unique Checkpoint Paths:
- 	Ensure each batch or streaming process has a unique checkpoint path. Reusing a checkpoint path for different tables or jobs can cause conflicts.

2.	Data Validation and Error Handling:
- 	Validate input data before processing.
- 	Capture errors using try-catch blocks or Spark’s foreachBatch() for detailed error handling.

3.	Retain Checkpoints:
- 	Don’t delete checkpoint data unless you intend to completely reset processing. If the checkpoint is deleted, the process will start from the beginning.

---

📌 3. Restarting Processing on Failure

If a batch process fails, you can simply restart the job, and it will resume from the last successful checkpoint.

🚀 Example Restart Logic

```scala
try {
  processedDF.write
    .format("delta")
    .mode("append")
    .option("checkpointLocation", checkpointPath)
    .save(deltaTablePath)
} catch {
  case e: Exception =>
    println(s"Error occurred: ${e.getMessage}")
    // Optionally send alert or log the error
}
```

---

📌 4. Fetching Latest Version of Updates

When your job resumes, it will start from the last committed state stored in the checkpoint.

To fetch the latest version of the Delta table:

```scala
val latestDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .load(deltaTablePath)

latestDF.show()
```

---

📌 5. Rollback Mechanism (If Needed)

If you accidentally process incorrect data or need to rollback to a previous state, you can use Delta Lake’s time travel feature.

🔙 Rollback Example

```scala
// Rollback to version 10
val rollbackDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .option("versionAsOf", "10")
  .load(deltaTablePath)

rollbackDF.show()
```

---

📌 6. Triggering Pipeline using Databricks Workflows

Configure your job using Databricks Workflows and specify dependencies to trigger the pipeline when:
- 	New data arrives in your S3 location.
- 	Another job completes successfully.
- 	A specific schedule (e.g., daily batch update).

---

🔑 Key Takeaways

1.	Always specify a unique checkpoint location for each table or job.
2.	Checkpoints are updated only after successful processing, ensuring resilience against failures.
3.	Use Delta Lake’s versioning and time travel for rollback and troubleshooting.
4.	Databricks Workflows provide a reliable way to trigger your pipeline.

## ✅ Triggering Workflow on S3 File Arrival


You don’t need to keep a cluster running all the time. Databricks provides a way to trigger a workflow when new data arrives in your S3 bucket using File Arrival triggers. Here’s how to set it up.

--- 

🔍 Approach

When a file lands in a specific S3 location, the workflow will be triggered. The cluster starts automatically when the trigger is detected.

📌 Steps to Configure File Arrival Trigger

1.	Create a Workflow in Databricks
- 	Go to the Workflows page in your Databricks workspace.
- 	Click on Create Workflow.

2.	Add Job to Workflow
- 	Define your job (Notebook, Spark Submit, or Delta Live Table).
- 	Provide the appropriate configuration for your job.

3.	Set Trigger Type to File Arrival
- 	Under the Trigger section, select File Arrival.
- 	Specify the S3 path where your files will be uploaded.
- 	Example: s3://your-bucket-name/incoming-data/.

4.	Set Matching Pattern (Optional)
- 	If you want to trigger only for certain files, you can specify a regex pattern.
- 	Example: .*\.parquet to trigger only for Parquet files.

5.	Set Cluster Policy
- 	Configure your cluster to start automatically when triggered.
- 	Set Auto Termination to a reasonable time (e.g., 30 minutes) to save costs.

6.	Save and Activate Workflow
- 	Save the workflow configuration.
- 	Enable it by clicking on Activate.


---

📌 How It Works

- 	When a file is uploaded to the specified S3 path, the workflow will be triggered.
- 	Databricks will automatically start the cluster, execute the job, and terminate the cluster when done (if configured).
- 	No need to keep the cluster running all the time, which saves costs.

---

📌 Best Practices

1.	Use Checkpointing: Always specify a checkpointLocation for your streaming reads and writes.
2.	Cluster Auto Termination: Enable auto termination to prevent idle clusters from incurring unnecessary costs.
3.	Trigger Filter Patterns: Use file patterns to avoid unnecessary triggers (e.g., avoid triggering on temporary or partial files).
4.	Error Handling: Configure retries and monitoring to handle potential failures gracefully.


---

## ✅ Delta Live Tables Pipeline in Workflow: Key Points


No, Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipelines do not need a cluster running all the time. They are designed to be triggered on demand or scheduled, which makes them cost-efficient and scalable.

1.	Cluster Management:
- 	DLT Pipelines automatically manage clusters.
- 	Clusters are started when the pipeline is triggered and are terminated when the job is completed, according to the pipeline configuration.

2.	Trigger Types:
- 	Triggered Pipelines: Executes once and then terminates. This is suitable for batch processing (e.g., daily, hourly).
- 	Continuous Pipelines: Continuously processes incoming data in near-real-time. Suitable for streaming use cases.

3.	Workflow Integration:
- 	You can orchestrate DLT pipelines using Databricks Workflows without needing a dedicated, always-on cluster.
- 	When the workflow triggers the DLT pipeline, it spins up the cluster automatically, runs the processing, and then shuts down the cluster.

---

🚀 Efficient Triggering & Cluster Management

If you want to run your pipeline daily from S3 data updates, you should use:

- 	Triggered DLT Pipelines: This will process the data once and then shut down the cluster.
- 	Event-Driven Triggering: (e.g., File arrival triggers) to only run the pipeline when new data is detected in your S3 bucket.

---

📌 Example DLT Pipeline Configuration in Workflow

```json
{
  "pipeline_name": "Daily_Update_Pipeline",
  "trigger": "Triggered", 
  "source": "s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/",
  "cluster_policy": "Auto-Termination",
  "schedule": "0 0 * * *"  // This will run daily at midnight
}
```

---

📊 Why This is Efficient

1.	No Always-On Cluster:
- 	You don’t need a cluster running continuously. Instead, it’s automatically created and terminated by DLT.

2.	Cost Savings:
- 	You’re only billed for the processing time, not idle time.

3.	Scalability:
- 	DLT handles scaling based on the data processing requirements.

4.	Fault Tolerance:
- 	With proper checkpointing, you can resume processing from failures.

---

🔑 Best Approach for Your Use Case

- 	Since you’re doing daily batch updates from S3 to a Delta table, you should use:
- 	Triggered Delta Live Table Pipeline (Batch Processing)
- 	Databricks Workflows with File Arrival Triggers to start the job only when new data is detected.
- 	Enable checkpointing to ensure resilience against failures.

---


## ✅ Approach: Event-Driven Triggering Using S3 Event Notifications


📂 S3 Folder Structure

```scala
s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/
    ├── 23233667/
    ├── 34454534/
    ├── 34534565/
```

Each folder (23233667, 34454534, etc.) is named by epoch time, indicating when the data was delivered.

---

📌 Step 1: Enable S3 Event Notifications

1.	Go to your S3 bucket in AWS Management Console.
2.	Navigate to Properties > Event notifications.
3.	Click on Create event notification:
  - 	Name: NewDataArrival
  - 	Event types: PUT (for object creation) — This triggers when a new folder is added.
  - 	Prefix: incoming-data/ (Ensures it only monitors that path).
  - 	Suffix: / (To only trigger on folders, not individual files).
  - 	Destination: Choose AWS SNS Topic, AWS Lambda, or AWS SQS.

💡 Recommended: Use AWS SNS Topic for seamless integration with Databricks Workflows.


---

📌 Step 2: Configure SNS Trigger in Databricks Workflow

1.	Create a Databricks Workflow:
- 	Go to the Jobs section of Databricks.
- 	Click Create Job.

2.	Set Up Workflow Trigger:
- 	Click on the Trigger tab.
- 	Choose Trigger type: AWS SNS.
- 	Provide your AWS SNS Topic ARN.
- 	Configure the workflow to trigger only when a message from the SNS topic is received.

3.	Add Your Processing Job:
- 	Add your DLT pipeline or a PySpark / Spark Structured Streaming job.
- 	Ensure it reads from the newly created folder using wildcard paths or file listing.

---

📌 Step 3: Configure Your Pipeline to Read New Folders Only

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

// Read from your S3 bucket and only pick the latest folder by epoch time
val s3Path = "s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/"

val latestFolder = spark.read.format("delta")
  .option("recursiveFileLookup", "true")
  .load(s3Path)
  .select(input_file_name())
  .withColumn("folder_name", regexp_extract(input_file_name(), "incoming-data/(.*?)/", 1))
  .withColumn("epoch_time", col("folder_name").cast("long"))
  .orderBy(desc("epoch_time"))
  .limit(1)
  .collect()(0)(0).toString

val latestDataPath = s"$s3Path$latestFolder/"
val df = spark.read.format("delta").load(latestDataPath)

df.show()
```

---

📌 Step 4: Enable Checkpointing

When you are processing the data, always use a checkpoint location to ensure reliability and recovery:

```scala
df.writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "s3://your-bucket/checkpoints/")
  .start("s3://your-bucket/processed-data/")
```

---

📌 Step 5: Restart Handling

If a job fails, Databricks Workflows will automatically retry the job based on your configuration. However, ensure you have proper checkpointing enabled for stateful recovery.


---

🔑 Why This Approach Works

1.	Efficient Triggering: Jobs are only triggered when new data folders are created.
2.	Event-Driven Pipeline: No need for an always-on cluster. Triggers are managed by AWS SNS.
3.	Data Filtering: Your pipeline reads only the most recent data based on folder name (epoch time).
4.	Fault Tolerance: Checkpointing ensures resiliency.


---

## ✅ Approach: Using Checkpointing to Track Processed Epoch Folders

Yes, absolutely! You can create a checkpoint for reading data from your S3 bucket and use it to ensure only the newly arrived or unprocessed epoch folders are processed.

Instead of tracking individual files, you will track which folders (batches) have already been processed. This is particularly useful when multiple folders (epoch timestamps) may arrive simultaneously or at different times.

---

📌 How This Works

1.	Create a Delta Table to Track Processed Epoch Folders.
2.	Read incoming folders and compare against the checkpoint Delta Table.
3.	Process only unprocessed folders.
4.	Update the checkpoint Delta Table once processing is complete.


📂 S3 Folder Structure

```scala
s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/
    ├── 23233667/
    ├── 34454534/
    ├── 34534565/
```

---


📌 Step 1: Create a Checkpoint Delta Table

Create a Delta table to track which epoch folders have been processed.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

// Define schema for checkpointing
val schema = new StructType()
  .add("epoch_folder", StringType, nullable = false)
  .add("processed_at", TimestampType, nullable = false)

// Create an empty Delta table if it doesn't exist
spark.sql("""
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_catalog.processed_folders (
    epoch_folder STRING,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP
  )
  USING DELTA
""")
```

--- 

📌 Step 2: Read New Folders from S3 Bucket

List all the epoch folders from the S3 bucket.

```scala
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.{FileSystem, Path}
import java.net.URI

val s3Path = "s3://your-bucket/incoming-data/"

val fs = FileSystem.get(new URI(s3Path), spark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration)
val status = fs.listStatus(new Path(s3Path))

val allFolders = status.filter(_.isDirectory).map(_.getPath.getName).toSeq

val allFoldersDF = spark.createDataFrame(allFolders.map(Tuple1(_))).toDF("epoch_folder")

// Show all detected folders
allFoldersDF.show()
```

---

📌 Step 3: Identify Unprocessed Folders

Filter the folders that have not been processed yet by comparing them against the checkpoint Delta Table.

```scala
// Load the checkpoint Delta Table
val processedDF = spark.table("your_catalog.processed_folders")

// Identify new folders to process
val unprocessedFolders = allFoldersDF.join(processedDF, Seq("epoch_folder"), "left_anti")

unprocessedFolders.show()
```

--- 

📌 Step 4: Process New Folders & Update Checkpoint Table

Process each new folder and update the checkpoint Delta Table after successful processing.

Parrell Processing

```scala
import java.sql.Timestamp
import java.time.Instant

unprocessedFolders.collect().foreach { row =>
  val folderName = row.getString(0)
  val folderPath = s"$s3Path$folderName/"

  // Read the data
  val df = spark.read.format("delta").load(folderPath)
  
  // Process the data (example operation)
  df.show()
  
  // Save processed folder info to the checkpoint table
  val processedDF = Seq((folderName, Timestamp.from(Instant.now())))
    .toDF("epoch_folder", "processed_at")

  processedDF.write
    .format("delta")
    .mode("append")
    .saveAsTable("your_catalog.processed_folders")
}

```

Sequential Processing

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
import java.sql.Timestamp
import java.time.Instant

// Load the checkpoint Delta Table
val processedDF = spark.table("your_catalog.processed_folders")

// Get the latest processed epoch (as String)
val latestProcessedEpoch = processedDF.agg(max(col("epoch_folder"))).collect()(0).getString(0).toLong

// Filter folders that are newer than the latest processed epoch
val newFolders = allFoldersDF
  .filter(col("epoch_folder").cast("long") > latestProcessedEpoch)
  .orderBy(col("epoch_folder").cast("long"))  // Process in sequential order from oldest to latest

newFolders.show()  // Display folders to be processed

// Process each new folder
newFolders.collect().foreach { row =>
  val folderName = row.getString(0)
  val folderPath = s"$s3Path$folderName/"

  println(s"Processing folder: $folderName")

  // Read the data from the folder
  val df = spark.read.format("delta").load(folderPath)
  
  // Example: Process the data (replace with your actual processing logic)
  df.show()

  // Save processed folder info to the checkpoint table
  val processedDF = Seq((folderName, Timestamp.from(Instant.now())))
    .toDF("epoch_folder", "processed_at")

  processedDF.write
    .format("delta")
    .mode("append")
    .saveAsTable("your_catalog.processed_folders")
  
  println(s"Successfully processed folder: $folderName")
}

```

🔍 Explanation of Changes

- 	latestProcessedEpoch Detection:
We only consider folders with epoch values greater than the latest processed epoch, ensuring no reprocessing of already handled folders.
- 	Sorting (orderBy) Before Processing:
The folders are sorted by epoch value so that they are processed in chronological order from oldest to newest.
- 	Sequential Processing:
Processing is done folder-by-folder to maintain order. If parallelism is desired, it can be modified, but sequential processing is often more reliable when handling time-series data.


---

📌 Step 5: Workflow Job Configuration

- 	Create a Databricks Workflow to run this job daily or based on AWS SNS Event Notification.
- 	Use the above code as your processing logic.
- 	Ensure your Delta checkpoint table is properly configured and accessible.


--- 

🔑 Why This Approach Works

1.	Persistent Tracking: Delta Table ensures you never reprocess the same epoch folder.
2.	Efficient Processing: Only unprocessed folders are processed, improving efficiency.
3.	Fault Tolerance: Checkpoints persist state even if your job fails or is restarted.
4.	Scalability: Works seamlessly even if multiple folders arrive at the same time.

Key Steps for Data Load Automation System




Framework Setup

Design a framework to orchestrate and monitor each pipeline step.

Ensure modular execution (each step is independent but chained).

Cluster & Index Monitoring

Monitor cluster health (CPU, memory, storage, job status).

Track index real-time status at each pipeline stage.

Confirm successful completion before triggering the next step.

Execution Control

Enforce strict sequencing (no step runs until prior step succeeds).

Support checkpointing to resume from last successful state.

Automated Error Handling & Recovery

Automatic retry for transient or recoverable failures.

Auto-recory mechanisms (restart jobs, refresh nodes, etc.).

Critical Failure Handling

Stop downstream tasks immediately on unrecoverable failure.

Send real-time alerts/notifications to the support team (e.g., email, Teams).

Manual Intervention Procedures

Document step-by-step process for manual recovery.

Provide rollback procedures for failed loads (cluster reset, index rollback, checkpoint restore).

Maintain audit logs of manual interventions.

Automation Enhancements 

Logging: Centralized logging with detailed error codes.

Version Control: Track pipeline and schema versions to ensure reproducibility.
