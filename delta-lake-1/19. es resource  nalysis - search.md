🧠 Interpretation

🔹 Resource Utilization
- 	CPU / Threads: Underutilized. Thread usage is extremely low.
- 	No thread rejections or queues → resources are not stressed.
- 	Memory/GC info not included here, but based on zero rejections and low active threads, there’s room to grow.

🔹 Performance
- 	Sustained QPS under 20 is modest for production-grade clusters.
- 	Latency spikes (up to 5s) suggest some expensive aggregations or poorly optimized queries.
- 	Query cost graphs confirm that some searches are unusually expensive — indicating a few outliers driving response time.

✅ Actionable Recommendations


| **Action**                                                  | **Justification**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increase search concurrency (threadpool.search.size)        | Search threads are underutilized (<0.01 active); cluster can handle more load    |
| Profile & rewrite heavy queries                              | Query cost & latency spikes imply specific inefficient aggregations or filters   |
| Introduce caching for repeated aggregations                 | Reduce cost/latency for repeatable queries                                       |
| Enable circuit breakers or cost-based query limits          | Prevent excessive load from high-cost aggregations                              |
| Reduce response size if possible                            | Avoid sending full result sets when not necessary                               |
| Tune `index.sort`, `doc_values`, or `eager_global_ordinals` | If aggregations are slow on text fields, sorting/indexing config may help       |
| Temporarily disable indexing workloads (if any)             | Maximize node availability for search during peak analytics                      |

🎯 Final Evaluation

The cluster appears underutilized for the search load it’s handling. There’s a significant opportunity to increase QPS, reduce latency, and scale throughput by:
- 	Increasing concurrency
- 	Optimizing or caching heavy queries
- 	Possibly improving indexing structure to support fast aggregations

#### ✅ Elasticsearch Performance Optimization Checklist (Search & Aggregation)

##### 🔧 Threading & Concurrency
- [ ] Increase `threadpool.search.size` if active threads consistently < 1
- [ ] Tune `threadpool.search.queue_size` to avoid spikes under load
- [ ] Monitor and scale based on `concurrent_search_requests` trends

##### 🔍 Query Design
- [ ] Profile high-cost queries using `search slowlog` and cost metrics
- [ ] Rewrite expensive aggregations or nested queries to reduce load
- [ ] Add filters to reduce total document hit count before aggregation
- [ ] Use `doc_values` for fields involved in aggregations
- [ ] Avoid `scripted_fields` in filters or aggregations unless necessary

##### 🧠 Caching & Reuse
- [ ] Enable or review Elasticsearch query cache (`request_cache`)
- [ ] Cache results of frequently repeated queries or dashboards
- [ ] Use terms filters with keyword fields to leverage filter cache

##### 📉 Response Size & Payload
- [ ] Use `size: 0` for aggregation-only queries to reduce payload
- [ ] Paginate results with `from`/`size` or `search_after` if large
- [ ] Minimize number of returned fields via `_source` filtering

##### 🧪 Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Track `QPS`, `response time`, and `query cost` over time
- [ ] Watch `max query cost` spikes and investigate
- [ ] Alert on `rejected search threads` or high queue times

##### 💽 Index Tuning
- [ ] Use `index.sort` for frequently sorted fields
- [ ] Set `eager_global_ordinals` on aggregation-heavy keyword fields
- [ ] Periodically force merge if segment count becomes excessive

##### 🚫 Resource Isolation
- [ ] Disable or deprioritize indexing during heavy search workloads
- [ ] Allocate dedicated data nodes for search-only traffic if needed

##### 🧾 Governance & Control
- [ ] Set cost-based limits using `search.max_buckets`, `max_terms_count`
- [ ] Implement query whitelisting or templates in UI-facing systems

🧠 Key Takeaways

🔹 Resource Utilization
- 	CPU & heap memory are moderately used, meaning there’s headroom to increase concurrency or reduce latency.
- 	Disk I/O and IO Wait are minimal, confirming that the workload is read-heavy, not storage-bound.
- 	GC performance is optimal: no JVM pressure, which is critical during aggregation-heavy queries.

🔹 Performance
- 	Node response times show occasional spikes → these likely align with high-cost queries or broad aggregations.
- 	Overall system load and thread activity are low, suggesting more aggressive tuning is possible to push QPS higher.

🧠 Key Takeaways

🔹 Resource Utilization
- 	CPU and memory are significantly underutilized, which is expected as client nodes primarily route queries and coordinate responses.
- 	No JVM pressure or GC bottlenecks, indicating smooth coordination of requests.
- 	Disk usage is irrelevant in client nodes unless used for local caching or logging, which is not apparent here.

🔹 Performance
- 	Since these are client nodes, their main role is request routing, aggregation coordination, and load balancing.
- 	Based on low CPU, load, and GC activity, they are not saturated, which means there is no bottleneck at the client layer.

| Circuit Breaking / Thread Queues       | Ensure settings like `search.max_buckets` and query breakers are tuned                |
| Client-to-Data Node Distribution       | Check `search.preference` and `shard awareness` to ensure balanced query routing      |
| Load Distribution                      | Monitor QPS per node to detect uneven client pressure                                 |
| Aggregation Complexity                 | If response latency is high, analyze coordinating cost (may shift load to client)     |
| JVM Settings                           | Continue default heap config unless coordinating queries show heap stress             |

📈 Final Evaluation

The client nodes are healthy, underutilized, and not a bottleneck. They provide ample headroom for increasing query throughput and concurrent aggregation processing. Focus tuning efforts on:

- 	Search and data nodes
- 	Query structure and complexity
- 	Cache usage and result reuse
