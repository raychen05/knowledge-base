## Centralized vs. Decoupled Stream Table

Great question — you're essentially weighing centralized vs. decoupled stream table design in Delta Lake for processing topic-document relationships across multiple content types (WOS, PPRN, patent), with downstream workflows having distinct triggers and processing logic per content type.

Let’s evaluate both options and determine the most optimal approach across efficiency, reliability, and workflow management.


---

✅ Option 1: One Stream Table for All Content Types

Structure:
- A single Delta stream table stores all topic-document relationships, differentiated by a content_type column (e.g., wos, pprn, patent).

Pros:
- ✅ Centralized schema — easier to manage ingestion pipeline.
- ✅ Single checkpoint and history — all changes are versioned in one location.
- ✅ Simplified table management (permissions, backup, etc.).
- ✅ Easier deduplication or global validation logic (if needed across content types).

Cons:
- ❌ Downstream complexity — each consumer has to filter by content_type, possibly scan irrelevant rows.
- ❌ Triggers get tangled — multiple types of logic (aggregation, facet mapping, etc.) in the same pipeline may require heavy branching or conditional logic.
- ❌ Rollback risk — failure in logic for one content type could impact all if you checkpoint the full stream.
- ❌ Workflow coupling — difficult to deploy content-specific updates independently.

---

✅ Option 2: Separate Stream Tables per Content Type

Structure:
  
*Three separate stream tables:

- wos_topics_stream
- pprn_topics_stream
- patent_topics_stream

Each one contains only the topic mappings for its content type.

Pros:
- ✅ Isolated pipelines — each has its own stream, checkpoint, and logic.
- ✅ Easier workflow management — deploy and monitor independently.
- ✅ Clear triggers per content — aggregation for WOS, facet join for PPRN, etc.
- ✅ Improved reliability — failure in one stream doesn’t impact the others.
- ✅ Rollback-safe — independent rollback and checkpointing.

Cons:
- ❌ Slightly more overhead in managing multiple tables and jobs.
- ❌ Potential for some duplicated code if ingestion logic is similar.

---

✅ Recommendation

For your case — distinct logic per content type, different downstream triggers, and a need for robust failure isolation and workflow control — the best, most scalable and production-safe solution is:

✅ Use separate Delta stream tables for each content type (WOS, PPRN, Patent).

This offers:

- Clean pipelines
- Safer retries
- Better modularity
- Clearer ownership and observability


---

🔁 Hybrid Option (Advanced)

If you must ingest from a unified upstream (e.g., Kafka topic or Bronze table), you can:

- Ingest into a single raw table.
- Then split into separate stream processing jobs per content type, writing to dedicated Delta stream tables.

This still gives you clean separation downstream while keeping upstream ingestion centralized.


---

## Hybrid Architecture Design

Let's walk through a hybrid architecture design for your use case in Databricks with Delta Lake, where:

- You have topics linked to different content types (WOS, PPRN, Patent).
- Each content type has independent processing logic.
- You want reliable, maintainable, and scalable stream handling.
- You're considering using a single input source, but separate stream jobs downstream.

---

✅ Hybrid Streaming Architecture Overview

🔹 Ingestion Flow

1. Raw Stream Source
Example: Kafka → Bronze Table (Delta)

- Unified schema: (doc_id, content_type, topic_id, event_time, metadata...)
- This is a central place where all topic-document events land.
- It can be a single Delta stream table (raw/bronze), e.g., topic_events_raw.

2. Stream Filtering by Content Type
Create separate stream processing jobs, each reading only the rows for one content type:

```scala
val rawDF = spark.readStream.table("topic_events_raw")

val wosDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "wos")
val pprnDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "pprn")
val patentDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "patent")

```

3. Process and Write to Content-specific Delta Tables
Each stream can apply its own logic and checkpoint independently:

```scala
wosDF
  .transform(customWosTopicLogic)
  .writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/checkpoints/wos")
  .outputMode("append")
  .table("topics_wos")

pprnDF
  .transform(customPprnFacetMapping)
  .writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/checkpoints/pprn")
  .outputMode("append")
  .table("topics_pprn")

```

✅ Benefits of This Approach


| Feature              | Benefit                                                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modular Streams      | Each stream is independent — you can scale, deploy, or debug separately. |
| Safe Checkpoints     | Failures in one stream don't affect others.                         |
| Dedicated Logic Paths| Logic for WOS, PPRN, and Patent stays clean and isolated.           |
| Easier Testing       | You can test each stream locally or in dev independently.           |
| Better Observability | You can monitor and alert per stream.                               |



---

✅ Optional: Trigger-Based Aggregations
If you want batch-like updates on a schedule or event, use Delta Live Tables (DLT) or triggerOnce streaming:

```scala
spark.read.table("topics_wos")
  .groupBy("researcher_id")
  .agg(collect_set("topic_id").as("topics"))
  .write
  .mode("overwrite")
  .saveAsTable("researcher_topic_agg_wos")
```

This can run on:

- A job schedule
- A trigger on data change (via DLT or logic layer)

## Architectural Templates

 Let's walk through the full hybrid architecture implementation step-by-step for your Delta Lake + Databricks streaming pipeline that processes topics linked to multiple content types (WOS, PPRN, Patent).


✅ Step 1: Define Unified Ingest Schema (Raw Table)

We'll use a single Bronze Delta table to ingest all raw topic-document mappings, differentiated by content type.

📦 Bronze Table: topic_events_raw

Schema Example:

```scala
root
 ├── doc_id: string
 ├── topic_id: string
 ├── content_type: string    // wos, pprn, patent
 ├── event_time: timestamp
 ├── metadata: struct<>      // optional: author, org, etc.


```

You might populate this via a Kafka stream, cloud event bus, or a batch load.


---

✅ Step 2: Create Separate Stream Pipelines for Each Content Type

Now we create independent streaming queries per content type.

🔹 WOS Topics Stream

```scala
val rawDF = spark.readStream.table("topic_events_raw")

val wosDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "wos")

val processedWosDF = wosDF.transform(applyWosTopicLogic)

processedWosDF.writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .outputMode("append")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoints/topic_wos")
  .table("topics_wos")

```

Where applyWosTopicLogic might include researcher aggregation, field-level tagging, etc.



🔹 PPRN Topics Stream

```scala
val pprnDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "pprn")

val processedPprnDF = pprnDF
  .join(spark.table("facet_lookup"), Seq("topic_id"), "left")
  .withColumn("facet_id", $"facet_lookup.facet_id")

processedPprnDF.writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .outputMode("append")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoints/topic_pprn")
  .table("topics_pprn")

```

This joins to a facet lookup to enrich topics with facet IDs.



🔹 Patent Topics Stream

```scala
val patentDF = rawDF.filter($"content_type" === "patent")

val processedPatentDF = patentDF.transform(applyPatentTopicLogic)

processedPatentDF.writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .outputMode("append")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoints/topic_patent")
  .table("topics_patent")

```

---

✅ Step 3: Downstream Aggregation with Triggers or Batch

You can use triggered queries or Delta Live Tables for downstream logic like:

WOS Researcher Aggregation:

```scala
spark.read.table("topics_wos")
  .join(spark.table("researcher_map"), Seq("doc_id"))
  .groupBy("researcher_id")
  .agg(collect_set("topic_id").as("topics"))
  .write
  .mode("overwrite")
  .saveAsTable("researcher_topic_agg_wos")

```

Run on a schedule or as part of a triggerOnce pipeline.


---

✅ Step 4: DLT (Optional for Manageability)

You can wrap each pipeline in a Delta Live Table (DLT) for:

- Easier pipeline orchestration
- Automated lineage tracking
- Built-in monitoring

Example DLT definition for WOS:

```scala
@dlt.table(name="topics_wos")
def wos_topics():
    return (
        dlt.read_stream("topic_events_raw")
        .filter(col("content_type") == "wos")
        .transform(applyWosTopicLogic)
    )
```

✅ Step 5: Summary of Best Practices


| Area           | Recommendation                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Checkpointing  | Use separate checkpoints for each stream job                    |
| Content logic  | Isolate per stream with `.transform(...)` or `withColumn`       |
| Recovery       | Independent restarts per stream job                             |
| Schema changes | Easier to evolve in smaller, dedicated tables                   |
| Monitoring     | Monitor per content stream (via DLT, jobs, or logs)             |
