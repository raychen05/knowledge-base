## bulk load to Elasticsearch from Delta Lake 

When performing a bulk load to Elasticsearch from Delta Lake (or any other source) using the org.elasticsearch.spark.sql connector, controlling factors like traffic, volume, speed, and threads is important to ensure optimal performance and avoid overloading the system. You can control these factors using various configuration options and optimizations provided by the Elasticsearch Spark connector.

✅ 1. Control Bulk Request Size

The bulk request size (the number of documents per batch) significantly affects the speed and traffic volume. Elasticsearch works best when bulk requests are neither too large nor too small. The optimal size varies depending on your data size and Elasticsearch cluster configuration.

You can control the bulk request size by setting the es.batch.size.entries and es.batch.size.bytes options:

```scala
val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your-es-node",      // Your Elasticsearch node
  "es.port" -> "9200",               // Your Elasticsearch port
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true",  // Automatically create the index if it doesn't exist
  "es.batch.size.entries" -> "1000", // Number of documents per batch (default is 200)
  "es.batch.size.bytes" -> "10mb",   // Size of data per batch (default is 5mb)
  "es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false" // Don't refresh the index after every bulk write (improves speed)
)

```

-	es.batch.size.entries: Controls how many documents are processed in each bulk request. You can increase or decrease this number based on the memory available and the optimal batch size for Elasticsearch.
-	es.batch.size.bytes: Limits the size of each bulk request by bytes. This ensures that the bulk requests do not exceed the memory limits or overwhelm Elasticsearch.

---

✅ 2. Control Number of Threads

You can control the number of threads (parallelism) used for bulk loading by adjusting the es.batch.write.thread parameter. This allows you to control how many threads are used to perform the bulk load operation concurrently.

```scala
val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your-es-node",
  "es.port" -> "9200",
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true",
  "es.batch.size.entries" -> "1000",   // Number of documents per bulk request
  "es.batch.size.bytes" -> "10mb",     // Max size of each bulk request
  "es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false",  // Avoid automatic refresh
  "es.batch.write.thread" -> "5"        // Number of threads used for bulk operations (adjust as needed)
)
```


---

✅ 3. Control Throughput and Volume with es.batch.write.retry.count and es.batch.write.retry.interval

You can control the retry behavior and traffic volume by adjusting the retry count and interval. This can be useful if your Elasticsearch cluster is experiencing heavy load or if you want to back off and retry in case of errors.

```scala
val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your-es-node",
  "es.port" -> "9200",
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true",
  "es.batch.size.entries" -> "1000",
  "es.batch.size.bytes" -> "10mb",
  "es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false",
  "es.batch.write.thread" -> "5", // Threads
  "es.batch.write.retry.count" -> "5", // Number of retry attempts for failed bulk requests
  "es.batch.write.retry.interval" -> "10s" // Interval between retry attempts
)

```

---

✅ 4. Rate Limiting for Traffic Control

To control the traffic volume and ensure that you don’t overwhelm your Elasticsearch cluster, you can use rate limiting. This is particularly useful if you are writing large volumes of data and need to throttle the requests.

You can control the rate of bulk writes by introducing a custom backoff or throttle mechanism. However, this is not directly available via the connector, but you can use some techniques to slow down the writes manually, such as:
-	Pause between Bulk Writes: You can introduce a delay between successive bulk write operations (e.g., using Thread.sleep() in Scala), though this is a more manual approach and not ideal for real-time systems.

---


✅ 5. Optimize Elasticsearch Indexing

When bulk loading, you should also consider configuring Elasticsearch indexing behavior for optimal performance:
-	Disable index refresh: Elasticsearch will perform an index refresh after every bulk request by default. You can disable this during bulk loading to speed up indexing:

```scala
"es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false"  // Disable refresh after each write
```

- Use a dedicated ingestion index: Instead of writing directly to your production index, write to an ingestion index and use Elasticsearch’s reindex API or a pipeline to move data into the production index.


---


✅ Example Code

Here’s how you can combine all of these options to control the bulk load process:

```scala
val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your-es-node",          // Elasticsearch node
  "es.port" -> "9200",                   // Port
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true",      // Auto-create index if it doesn't exist
  "es.batch.size.entries" -> "1000",     // Number of documents per batch
  "es.batch.size.bytes" -> "10mb",       // Max size of each batch (in bytes)
  "es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false",   // Disable index refresh after each write
  "es.batch.write.thread" -> "5",        // Number of threads for parallel bulk load
  "es.batch.write.retry.count" -> "5",   // Retry count
  "es.batch.write.retry.interval" -> "10s" // Retry interval
)

deltaDF.write
  .format("org.elasticsearch.spark.sql")
  .options(esBulkOptions)
  .mode("overwrite")  // Use "append" if you want to add to an existing index
  .save("your_index_name/_doc")

println("Bulk load completed successfully into Elasticsearch.")
```


📌 Final Thoughts
-	Traffic control: Batch size (es.batch.size.entries and es.batch.size.bytes) and retry logic (es.batch.write.retry.count) can help you manage the load.
-	Volume control: You can adjust the number of threads (es.batch.write.thread) and rate-limiting approaches to ensure that you are not overwhelming your Elasticsearch cluster.
-	Speed control: Depending on the size of the data and available resources, tweak these settings for the best performance.

## Elasticsearch Bulkload


To use Delta DataFrame (deltaDF) for a bulk load into Elasticsearch while including additional bulk load command metadata (like the Elasticsearch bulk API), you will need to transform the data into a format that Elasticsearch’s bulk API accepts.

The bulk API expects a series of actions in a specific format, where each action specifies an operation (index, update, delete, etc.) followed by the document to be indexed.

Step-by-Step Approach:
	1.	Transform DataFrame into Elasticsearch Bulk Format: To use bulk operations with Elasticsearch, you need to prepare your data in the correct format where each action is followed by the corresponding document.
	2.	Use the Bulk API Format: The format consists of a sequence of JSON objects, where the first object is the action (index, update, delete) and the second is the document itself.
	3.	Write the Data to Elasticsearch: You can do this by generating the appropriate actions for each row in the DataFrame and saving them to Elasticsearch.

Here’s how you can integrate the bulk API commands with Delta DataFrame data:


Example Code: Transforming deltaDF into Bulk API Format and Writing to Elasticsearch

--- 

1. Prepare the Bulk Load Format

You’ll need to convert the deltaDF to a format suitable for the Elasticsearch bulk API, where each action is followed by a document in the following format:

```json
{ "index" : { "_index" : "your_index_name", "_id" : "document_id" } }
{ "field1" : "value1", "field2" : "value2", ... }
```

---

2. Transform DataFrame

We will generate the bulk request format as a sequence of pairs, where one row will represent the operation (index, update, etc.) and the next will represent the document data.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.{SparkSession, DataFrame}
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your-es-node",          // Elasticsearch node
  "es.port" -> "9200",                   // Elasticsearch port
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true",      // Auto-create index if it doesn't exist
  "es.batch.size.entries" -> "1000",     // Number of documents per batch
  "es.batch.size.bytes" -> "10mb",       // Max size of each batch (in bytes)
  "es.batch.write.refresh" -> "false"    // Disable refresh after each bulk operation
)

// Convert the Delta DataFrame into Elasticsearch bulk format
val bulkData = deltaDF.rdd.flatMap { row =>
  val indexAction = s"""{"index":{"_index":"your_index_name","_id":"${row.getAs[String]("id")}"}}"""
  val document = row.getValuesMap[Any](row.schema.fieldNames).map {
    case (key, value) => s""""$key": "$value""""
  }.mkString("{", ",", "}")
  
  // Create the pair of the index action and document
  Seq(indexAction, document)
}

val bulkRDD = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(bulkData)

// Save to Elasticsearch using bulk API format
bulkRDD.saveAsTextFile("dbfs:/mnt/elasticsearch_bulk_load")  // Writing bulk commands to a text file

// Now you can use this file to load data into Elasticsearch using the bulk API
```

---

3. Write Bulk Data to Elasticsearch

After preparing the bulk load format, you can send it to Elasticsearch via a simple HTTP request using curl or directly via the Elasticsearch API.

Here’s an example of how to use curl to send the data:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://your-es-node:9200/your_index_name/_bulk" -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" --data-binary @dbfs:/mnt/elasticsearch_bulk_load
```

--- 

Additional Notes:

1.	Customizing Operations: You can customize the operations inside the bulk API by changing the action type from index to update or delete as needed. For example, if you want to perform an update rather than an index operation, you would modify the indexAction string to:

```scala
val updateAction = s"""{"update":{"_index":"your_index_name","_id":"${row.getAs[String]("id")}"}}"""
```

2.	Error Handling: Elasticsearch bulk operations will return a response containing success or failure for each item. Handling errors and retries in case of failure is critical for large-scale ingestion.

3.	Elasticsearch Bulk Limitations:
-	Bulk Size: The number of documents and size per bulk request should be tuned according to your Elasticsearch cluster’s capacity. Too many documents can lead to performance issues, while too few may cause excessive network overhead.
-	Indexing Strategy: Ensure you’re using an appropriate indexing strategy, such as time-based indices or using an ingestion pipeline for better performance.

Final Thought

This approach allows you to perform bulk loads with added control over the load operations and gives you the flexibility to specify additional commands for each document (e.g., index, update, delete).

##  Elasticsearch Bulk API vs. deltaDF.write

Both approaches—transforming the DataFrame to a bulk load file and using the save() method directly—have their pros and cons, and the best choice depends on the specific use case, performance considerations, and flexibility required.




1. Transform DataFrame to Bulk Load File & Use Elasticsearch Bulk API

How it Works:
-	You manually create the bulk data file, which contains the index actions and the corresponding documents.
-	After generating this file, you can use Elasticsearch’s bulk API to load the data, either using the curl command or Elasticsearch’s client libraries.

Pros:
-	Fine-grained control over bulk operations: You can customize the operation type (index, update, delete), which is useful if your data needs to undergo complex transformations or specific operations.
-	Better error handling: Bulk APIs provide a detailed response with success/failure for each document, allowing you to handle errors and retries more precisely.
-	Customizable batch size: You can control how many records are in each bulk request, which may help optimize performance based on your cluster’s load.
-	Supports large datasets: Writing data in smaller, controlled chunks using bulk commands can be more efficient when dealing with large volumes of data.

Cons:
-	More complex setup: You need to transform the data into the appropriate format and handle the orchestration of the bulk loading process.
-	Manual intervention: You might need to handle retries or adjustments to the batch size manually.
-	External tooling: If you’re not using Elasticsearch’s client libraries, you may need to rely on external tools like curl or the Python client, adding complexity to your pipeline.

---

2. Write DataFrame Directly to Elasticsearch with deltaDF.write

How it Works:
-	This approach uses Spark’s Elasticsearch Connector to directly write the DataFrame to an Elasticsearch index. The save() method allows you to load the data directly without having to manually handle the bulk API format.

Pros:
-	Simplicity: The write API is much simpler and requires less code. You can directly write the data from Spark to Elasticsearch.
-	Built-in support for batch operations: The connector handles the bulk loading in the background, so you don’t need to manually manage the bulk data format.
-	Scalability: Since this approach leverages Spark’s distributed computing, it can scale horizontally across large datasets.
-	Automatic retries: The connector often includes mechanisms for retrying failed writes, which simplifies the error-handling logic.

Cons:
-	Less control: You have less control over the specific bulk operations. For example, you cannot easily switch between index, update, or delete operations without additional configurations.
-	Performance tuning limitations: While the connector provides some tuning options (like es.batch.size.entries), you have less fine-grained control over how data is batched and written compared to using the bulk API directly.
-	Less flexibility: If you need to perform complex operations or transformations on the data during the load (e.g., conditional updates), the bulk load API approach might be more appropriate.

---

When to Use Which Approach

-	Use Direct deltaDF.write Approach If:
-	You have simple indexing requirements and you just need to write data to Elasticsearch with minimal configuration.
-	Your Elasticsearch schema is simple and you don’t need to perform complex operations like updates or deletions.
-	You’re working with a straightforward, scalable data pipeline and want to minimize manual intervention and configuration.
-	Use Bulk API (File Generation) Approach If:
-	You need fine-grained control over the bulk load operations (e.g., indexing vs. updating documents).
-	You have large data volumes and need to optimize the batch size or manage retries and error handling manually.
-	You want to control specific index operations, such as using conditional updates, or you need to interact with Elasticsearch features that the direct connector does not easily support.
-	You need to perform complex transformations before loading the data into Elasticsearch.


Conclusion

-	For simple, high-performance indexing, using deltaDF.write directly is typically sufficient and easier to implement.
-	For advanced use cases requiring finer control over the bulk load process (such as handling updates, deletes, or complex transformations), generating the bulk load file and using the Elasticsearch Bulk API directly provides more flexibility.

##  Example -  20 million documents with over 1,000 fields


For loading and updating 20 million documents with over 1,000 fields, the approach you choose needs to prioritize performance, efficiency, and reliability. Let’s break down the considerations for each approach in this context:



1. Direct deltaDF.write Approach (Using Spark’s Elasticsearch Connector)

Pros for Large-Scale Data Loads (20 Million Documents, 1,000+ Fields):
-	High Throughput: The Spark Elasticsearch connector is optimized for large-scale data loads and can efficiently write large amounts of data in parallel across the cluster. This is essential when dealing with large datasets like the one you’re describing.
-	Automatic Handling of Bulk Operations: The connector handles batch processing internally, splitting data into manageable chunks and distributing it across nodes. It is designed to optimize performance, especially with large volumes of data.
-	Scalability: Since Spark runs on a distributed system, the data can be partitioned and processed in parallel, which will significantly speed up the load process.
-	Minimal Code Complexity: You don’t have to manually create the bulk load JSON file or manage the bulk API interactions; this reduces the complexity of your code and workflow.

Cons:
-	Less Control: If you need to update documents (instead of just indexing), it may be harder to control this behavior directly through the Spark connector, as the default behavior is to overwrite or append to the index. To handle updates, you would typically need a mechanism to check if the document already exists (e.g., using an ID field).
-	Performance Tuning: While the connector handles batching and writing efficiently, you might not have the level of fine-grained control you need to tune every aspect of the bulk operation (e.g., precise control over the size of each batch, custom retry logic, etc.).

---

2. Elasticsearch Bulk API (Transforming Data into Bulk Format)

Pros for Large-Scale Updates (20 Million Documents, 1,000+ Fields):
-	Fine-grained Control: The bulk API allows you to control exactly how each document is indexed, updated, or deleted. If you need to update existing documents (instead of just indexing new ones), you can specify this in the bulk request (via the update action).
-	Batch Control: You can define the batch size, the number of records per batch, and tweak other parameters like retry logic, error handling, and backoff strategies, allowing for better optimization based on your Elasticsearch cluster’s performance.
-	Error Handling and Retry Logic: The bulk API returns a detailed response, so you can handle errors (e.g., documents that failed to index) and retry failed operations.
-	Custom Operations: If your use case involves conditional updates or merging document fields based on specific rules, the bulk API provides more flexibility to do this.

Cons:
-	Complexity: You need to manually generate the bulk API file, format it in NDJSON, and use curl or a client to upload it to Elasticsearch. This adds complexity to the process.
-	Memory Management: Generating and processing bulk requests with 20 million documents might require a significant amount of memory, especially if you’re dealing with 1,000+ fields. You need to ensure that the bulk data doesn’t overwhelm your system’s resources.
-	Manual Orchestration: You need to take care of splitting the data into appropriate batches, managing retries, and ensuring that Elasticsearch doesn’t become overwhelmed by too many concurrent bulk requests.

---

Which Approach is Better for 20 Million Documents with 1,000+ Fields?

Given the scale and complexity (20 million documents and 1,000+ fields), here are some considerations:

-	For Bulk Load with Simple Indexing (No Updates):
If your operation is just inserting new data (i.e., no updates to existing documents), the deltaDF.write approach is generally better. It is easier to implement, provides high throughput with Spark’s distributed capabilities, and is optimized for large datasets. Since Elasticsearch is designed to handle bulk loads efficiently, using the connector will give you better performance without needing to manage batches or retries manually.
-	For Bulk Load with Updates (You Need to Update Existing Documents):
If your use case requires updating existing documents (and not just appending new ones), the Bulk API approach might be better. The reason is that Spark’s connector does not have native support for sophisticated document updates. You will need to handle conditional updates, and custom merging of fields, which can be difficult with the direct deltaDF.write approach. The Bulk API gives you more control over whether each document is indexed or updated.

Recommendation:

-	Simple Bulk Insert: If you just need to insert documents (not update), use the direct deltaDF.write method. It’s simpler, and optimized for large-scale bulk operations.
-	Bulk Insert with Updates: If you need to perform both insertions and updates (for example, by using a unique document ID to identify updates), then use the Bulk API approach. This will give you more control and flexibility over the update behavior, allowing you to specify whether each document is indexed or updated.

Additional Tips for Large-Scale Loads:

-	Optimize Elasticsearch Index Settings: Consider adjusting your Elasticsearch index settings (e.g., sharding and replication) and mapping to optimize for high write throughput.
-	Tune Batch Size: In both cases (whether using Spark or the Bulk API), experiment with different batch sizes (e.g., 5,000 to 100,000 documents per batch) to find the optimal size for your Elasticsearch cluster.
-	Avoid Refreshing on Every Write: When performing large bulk operations, avoid forcing Elasticsearch to refresh the index on every write. You can disable the refresh during the bulk load and refresh it manually afterward to improve performance.


In summary, if you need simple bulk inserts, the deltaDF.write approach is likely your best bet for simplicity and performance. If you need advanced updates or custom handling per document, the Bulk API approach would be more flexible, albeit with more complexity.

##  full record update vs.  partial record update

When dealing with 20 million documents and over 1,000 fields, the decision between full record update and partial record update depends on several factors, including the size of the data, the frequency of changes, and the specific use case. Here’s a breakdown of when each approach is better and the trade-offs involved.



1. Full Record Update

A full record update means replacing the entire document in Elasticsearch whenever it is modified.

Pros:

-	Simplicity: Full record updates are straightforward to implement. You don’t need to worry about tracking the fields that have changed; you simply update the entire document.
-	Consistency: The full document will always be consistent in Elasticsearch, as you’re re-indexing the whole record.
-	Index Integrity: If any field within a document is updated, you don’t have to worry about potential inconsistencies (e.g., missing fields or misaligned partial updates).

Cons:

-	Higher Resource Consumption: Since you’re replacing the entire document, this can lead to more resource usage, especially if the document has many fields (in your case, over 1,000). The larger the document, the more storage space and memory are required.
-	Higher Latency: For every update, Elasticsearch has to delete the old document and index the new one, which can result in higher latency and a more resource-intensive process.
-	Overwrites Entire Document: If only a small part of the document changes, you’re still re-indexing the entire document. This is inefficient in scenarios where only small updates are needed.

When to Use Full Record Updates:

-	When the entire document needs to be updated frequently or when changes to individual fields are highly interdependent.
-	When you have a relatively low update frequency, and re-indexing entire documents won’t significantly impact performance.
-	When the size of your documents is manageable, and Elasticsearch can handle the overhead of re-indexing them.

---

2. Partial Record Update

A partial record update means only the specific fields that have changed are updated in Elasticsearch, rather than replacing the entire document.

Pros:
-	Lower Resource Consumption: Since only the modified fields are indexed, this reduces the amount of data being sent over the network and reduces the processing and storage overhead.
-	Faster Updates: Partial updates are more efficient for scenarios where only a small part of the document is modified, as they avoid re-indexing the entire document.
-	Scalability: Partial updates scale better when you have large documents with many fields, especially if only a few fields are updated at a time.

Cons:

-	Complexity: To implement partial updates, you need to know which fields have changed and how to structure the update. This can be more complex to manage, especially if you don’t have an efficient way to track changes at the field level.
-	Potential for Inconsistencies: If not properly managed, partial updates can lead to inconsistencies. For example, a missing field in an update request can cause it to be absent from the document, even though it was part of the original document.
-	Requires Update Query: Elasticsearch needs to track the document ID for partial updates, which adds some complexity to the indexing process.

When to Use Partial Record Updates:

-	When only a small subset of fields changes, and re-indexing the entire document is inefficient.
-	When you need to update large datasets and want to optimize for performance and resource consumption.
-	When you can track changes at the field level, and the cost of managing partial updates is worth the performance gain.
-	When update frequency is high, and avoiding full document re-indexing would improve efficiency.

---

Which Approach is Better for 20 Million Documents with 1,000+ Fields?

For your specific scenario of 20 million documents with 1,000+ fields, here’s a recommendation based on the context:

Consider Partial Record Update:
-	Efficiency: Given that each document has over 1,000 fields, performing full document updates can quickly become inefficient, especially when only a few fields change. Partial updates would be more efficient because they reduce the amount of data being written to Elasticsearch, which can significantly improve performance, especially at scale.
-	Scalability: As your dataset grows (20 million documents), the performance gains from partial updates are likely to become even more significant. Writing full records for every update can lead to more strain on Elasticsearch resources, while partial updates allow for more efficient resource utilization.
-	Low Latency: If you have frequent updates, partial updates will help reduce the time it takes to perform the update since you’re not re-indexing the entire document.

When Full Record Update Might Be Better:
-	Consistency Concerns: If there’s a strong need for ensuring that the full document remains in a consistent state across all fields (for example, if certain fields depend on others), full record updates might be necessary.
-	Simplicity: If managing partial updates is too complex, or if the fields that change are not easy to track, you might prefer full record updates to simplify the process.

Recommendation:
-	For Large Scale Updates (20 million documents, 1,000+ fields), partial updates are likely the better choice in terms of performance, scalability, and resource consumption. This approach minimizes the amount of data transferred and processed by Elasticsearch, making it more efficient for high-volume, frequent updates.

--- 
Key Considerations for Partial Updates:

1.	Track Changes: You’ll need a system to track which fields have changed. For example, you could use a change data capture (CDC) process or track updates in your ETL pipeline.
2.	Update Strategy: Ensure that your update mechanism doesn’t accidentally omit important fields. Use partial update APIs to add new fields or update existing ones, without losing data.
3.	Document Size and Sharding: Since you have a large number of fields and potentially large documents, consider optimizing your Elasticsearch index mappings and sharding strategy to handle these updates efficiently.

In summary, partial record updates are generally the more efficient and scalable approach for handling large datasets with frequent updates, especially when documents contain a large number of fields.


--- 

## Partial Update with Bulk Load Example

When performing bulk loading, you can use the update action for each document. This update action can be used to partially update the document by specifying only the fields that need to be changed. The document ID is required for partial updates, and you will provide a doc field that contains the fields to be updated.

Here’s an example of how to perform a bulk partial update using a DataFrame in Spark (with Scala), which writes data to Elasticsearch.

Step-by-Step Example

---

1.	Prepare DataFrame:
You first need a DataFrame in Spark that contains the document IDs and the fields you want to update.
Here’s an example DataFrame deltaDF where each row contains the document ID and fields to update.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val deltaDF = spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .load("path_to_your_delta_table")

// Example DataFrame with document IDs and fields to update
val updateDF = deltaDF.select("doc_id", "field_to_update_1", "field_to_update_2")
  .withColumn("doc", struct("field_to_update_1", "field_to_update_2"))  // Select the fields to update
  .withColumn("op", lit("update")) // Add operation type, used in the bulk request
```

--- 

2.	Prepare Bulk Request for Partial Update:
Now you will transform the DataFrame into the appropriate format for the Elasticsearch bulk API. For a partial update, you would use the update action in the bulk request, specifying the document ID and the fields to update.

```scala
import org.elasticsearch.spark.sql._

val esBulkOptions = Map(
  "es.nodes" -> "your_es_nodes",
  "es.port" -> "9200",
  "es.index.auto.create" -> "true", // Optionally auto-create index if not exists
  "es.resource" -> "your_index_name/_doc"
)

// Prepare the bulk update by adding a doc field and action type (update)
val bulkDF = updateDF
  .selectExpr(
    "doc_id as _id", 
    "op as _op", 
    "doc as _source"
  )

// Write the bulk update to Elasticsearch
bulkDF.write
  .format("org.elasticsearch.spark.sql")
  .options(esBulkOptions)
  .mode("append")
  .save()
```

Bulk Request Format:

In Elasticsearch, the bulk update format looks like this:

```json
{ "update": { "_id": "doc_id_1", "_index": "your_index_name" } }
{ "doc": { "field_to_update_1": "new_value_1", "field_to_update_2": "new_value_2" } }
{ "update": { "_id": "doc_id_2", "_index": "your_index_name" } }
{ "doc": { "field_to_update_1": "new_value_3" } }
```


---

Here’s how it works:

-	The first line in each pair is the action (update), which includes the document ID (_id) and the index (_index).
-	The second line contains the partial update (doc), which specifies only the fields to update (e.g., field_to_update_1 and field_to_update_2).

Using Bulk Update for Partial Updates:

-	Update Operation: The update operation will not replace the entire document, it will only modify the specified fields.
-	Doc Field: Only the fields inside the doc field will be updated; other fields in the document remain unchanged.
-	Efficiency: This approach is efficient for updating large datasets, as only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request, and the documents are not fully re-indexed.

Important Notes:

1.	Document ID: The document ID (_id) is necessary for updating a document. Elasticsearch needs to know which document to update.
2.	Partial Update: In the doc field, you only need to specify the fields you want to update. The rest of the document stays unchanged.
3.	Bulk Size: When using bulk updates, you should ensure that the bulk request size is manageable. You may need to control the bulk size to avoid overwhelming the Elasticsearch cluster.


Considerations:

-	Bulk Size: Too large of a bulk size can lead to performance issues. Typically, batches of 5,000–10,000 updates per request are recommended, but this depends on your specific use case and cluster resources.
-	Handling Errors: Bulk requests can fail for individual documents. You should have error handling in place to retry or log the failed updates.


Conclusion:

The partial update approach with bulk loading is highly efficient when dealing with large datasets like the one you described (20 million documents, 1000+ fields). It minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed by Elasticsearch, thus improving both speed and resource usage.

---

##  partial updates are generally better than full record updates in Elasticsearch?


Yes, partial updates are generally better than full record updates in Elasticsearch, especially when dealing with large datasets (such as 20+ million records), for several reasons:

---

Why Partial Updates Are Better:

1.	Efficiency and Performance:
-	Partial updates only modify the specified fields, whereas full updates reindex the entire document, even if only a small portion of it has changed.
-	With 20+ million records, reindexing the full document for each change can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. In contrast, partial updates only send and process the fields that actually changed, which is much more efficient.

2.	Reduced I/O and Network Overhead:
-	Partial updates reduce the amount of data transferred between your application and Elasticsearch. Only the updated fields are sent in the bulk request, whereas full updates would require the entire document to be sent, increasing network traffic and Elasticsearch load.
-	For large datasets, this reduction in data transfer can significantly improve performance, as Elasticsearch doesn’t need to process unnecessary data.

3.	Lower Resource Consumption:
-	Full updates force Elasticsearch to reindex the entire document, which can be resource-intensive, particularly for documents with many fields. This also impacts Elasticsearch’s disk space, as the full document is indexed again.
-	Partial updates save disk space and indexing time because only the modified parts of the document are reindexed.

4.	Avoiding Document Versioning Overhead:
-	Elasticsearch uses a versioning system to track changes to documents. In the case of full document updates, each update creates a new version of the entire document, which may increase the overall storage needs and the time spent on indexing.
-	Partial updates avoid creating new versions of unchanged fields, which can help minimize storage overhead and indexing time.

Considerations for Using Partial Updates:

-	Complexity: Partial updates require a good understanding of the document structure and the specific fields that need to be updated. If you’re updating large numbers of documents and many fields are changing, it might be challenging to track those fields manually.
-	Merging Fields: If a document needs to be updated in many fields, partial updates will only update the fields specified. This is great for large documents where only a small portion needs to change. However, if the entire document structure needs to be changed, full updates might be easier to manage in certain cases.

---

When Partial Updates May Not Be Sufficient:

There are scenarios where partial updates may not be ideal:

-	If the entire document structure changes (e.g., you need to add or remove a significant number of fields), a full update might be easier.
-	If the logic for tracking updates to specific fields is complex or inconsistent, it may be better to perform a full document update to ensure data integrity.

Performance Considerations for 20+ Million Documents:

1.	Bulk Size: When dealing with 20+ million records, you should batch your updates into smaller chunks (e.g., 5,000–10,000 updates per bulk request). This helps avoid overwhelming Elasticsearch and ensures better throughput.
2.	Elasticsearch Cluster Size: Ensure that your Elasticsearch cluster is sized appropriately for handling these kinds of operations. You may need to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) closely to ensure that partial updates are not causing resource contention.
3.	Indexing Speed: If the documents are large (with 1000+ fields), partial updates are much faster because Elasticsearch only needs to reindex the changed fields, not the whole document.
4.	Document Structure: If you’re constantly updating specific fields across many documents (e.g., status fields, numerical counters, etc.), partial updates are optimal because they target only the fields that change.

Final Recommendation:

For a large-scale system with 20+ million records, partial updates will generally be the better approach because they:
-	Minimize the load on Elasticsearch
-	Reduce network traffic and I/O overhead
-	Improve indexing and performance by avoiding reindexing full documents

However, if the changes are very broad and affect most of the document’s fields, you may want to consider full updates in those specific cases, but partial updates should be the default for efficiency.

##  Elasticsearch partial update


In Elasticsearch, you cannot update a partial field directly in the Lucene index without rewriting the entire document. This is because of how Elasticsearch and Lucene work under the hood. Let’s break down why this is the case:


🔍 Why Partial Field Updates Are Not Possible in Lucene

1.	Immutable Index Segments:
-	Lucene (the underlying library Elasticsearch uses) stores data in immutable segments. Once a segment is written to disk, it cannot be modified.
-	To “update” a document, Elasticsearch marks the old document as deleted and writes a new, updated document to a new segment.

2.	Field-Level Granularity Is Not Supported:
-	Elasticsearch supports document-level indexing, not field-level indexing.
-	When you perform an update, even if it’s a partial update, the entire document is reindexed internally, but only the changed fields are rewritten.
-	However, Elasticsearch will create a new version of the document with the updated fields and mark the old version as deleted.

3.	Segment Merging:
-	Over time, segments are merged for efficiency, and deleted documents are physically removed from the disk.
-	This process makes partial updates efficient in Elasticsearch because older, deleted documents will be cleaned up eventually.

✅ How Partial Updates Work in Elasticsearch

-	When you perform a partial update (_update API or Bulk API with update operation), Elasticsearch:
	1.	Retrieves the existing document from the index (from disk if not cached).
	2.	Merges the updated fields with the existing document.
	3.	Indexes the entire new document as a new version in a new segment.
	4.	Marks the old document as deleted.
-	While the entire document is reindexed internally, it’s still more efficient than a full update because:
-	Only the modified fields are processed for indexing.
-	Elasticsearch avoids rewriting unchanged data.
-	Partial updates are faster and use fewer resources than rewriting the entire document if only a few fields are changed.


---

💡 Best Practice for Large Datasets (20+ Million Records, 1000+ Fields)

-	Partial updates are more efficient than full updates when only a few fields change.
-	But Elasticsearch will still create a new document version, so it is not a pure field-level update.
-	If you’re frequently updating a subset of fields, consider indexing those fields separately using:
-	Nested objects or parent-child relationships to isolate parts of the document.
-	Index splitting: Storing frequently updated fields in a separate index.


📊 Conclusion

-	Partial updates are still the preferred method for updating parts of documents in Elasticsearch.
-	However, it’s important to understand that the entire document is reindexed internally by Elasticsearch, even though you’re only updating some fields.
-	To avoid performance issues with large documents, consider breaking up documents into smaller, related documents.
