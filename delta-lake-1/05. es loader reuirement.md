### Refactoring the ES Loader to Meet New Requirements:


1.	Task Segmentation and Management:
- Split the loader tasks into managed tasks, including: 
Load (initial loading of data)
    - Validate (data integrity checks)
    - Forcemerge (merging indices to optimize storage)
    - Snapshot (taking backups of the data)
    - Statistics (collecting and reporting on i- ndex metrics)
    - Additional tasks as necessary based on specific project needs.

2.	Automating the Load Process:
- Implement automation to trigger the data load process dynamically based on changes in source data.

3.	Delta Table Integration:
- Ensure the loader is capable of loading data from delta tables to keep the process efficient and up to date.

4.	Independent Index Loading and Validation:
- Support loading of various indices independently, while ensuring data validation occurs for each index.

5.	Logging, Alerting, and Notifications:
- Implement robust logging mechanisms to capture the status and errors during the loading process.
- Integrate failure alerting and notification systems to inform stakeholders about process failures, delays, or significant anomalies.

6.	Failure Recovery Mechanism:
- Enable failure recovery from the exact failure point, ensuring the process can resume without needing to restart from the beginning, reducing unnecessary overhead and downtime.

7.	Index Data Summary Reporting:
- Create detailed summaries of index data after each load process, including key metrics such as: 
    - Load time
    - Document count
    - Index size
    - Percentage increase/decrease in data volume since the last load
    - Other relevant data points to track performance and growth.

8.	Performance Monitoring and Optimization:
- Continuously monitor the performance of the loader to identify bottlenecks or areas of improvement.
- Optimize the loaderâ€™s speed, efficiency, and resource utilization, ensuring minimal impact on system performance.
  
9.	Versioning and Compatibility:
- Ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the loader, while introducing new features.
- Implement version control for the loader itself to track and manage changes over time.
