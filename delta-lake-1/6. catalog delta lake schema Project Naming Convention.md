## Best Practices for Delta Lake Naming Convention

A standardized, professional, and simplified naming convention should ensure:
- ✅ Clarity: Meaningful names that avoid ambiguity.
- ✅ Consistency: Standardized across datasets.
- ✅ Scalability: Supports future data growth and new types.
- ✅ Versioning Control: Clearly differentiates between versions and changes.

### Catalog Naming Convention

### Schema Naming Convention

Schemas (Databases) should group tables based on functional category.

Recommended Schema Names:

| **Schema Name** | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| source          | Stores raw metadata from publications, researchers, organizations, grants, patents, etc. |
| metrics         | Stores different levels of research and citation metrics (article, institution, category). |
| relations       | Stores all relationships between documents, researchers, citations, patents. |
| enriched        | Stores processed & derived data like research topics, profile summaries.    |
| lookup          | Stores indexes, dictionaries, and search-friendly tables.                   |
| temp            | Stores intermediate, temporary tables.                                      |
| udm             | Stores product UDM data for data release                                     |
| wosri_bbd       | Stores BDD version UDM tables usefd creating BDD baseline and image.           |
| incites_bbd     | Stores BDD version UDM tables usefd creating BDD baseline and image.           |

Key Points:
-	More clarity (schemas clearly reflect the data lifecycle).
-	Less redundancy (removes confusion between meta, metrics, and relation).
-	Better scalability (easy to extend new research datasets without schema clashes).

### Table Naming Convention

-	Use lowercase with underscores (_) for readability.
-	Prefix the table with a short category identifier.
-	Use singular nouns for tables.

Recommended Table Names:


---

### Live Table Naming (Databricks Live Tables)


-	Prefix live tables with lt_ to differentiate from batch tables.
-	Use the same naming conventions as batch tables.
-	Example:
    -	lt_publication
    -	lt_article_metrics
    -	lt_doc2doc_citation

---

### Versioning Convention

For version control in Delta Lake:

-	Use timestamps (e.g., _vYYYYMMDD).
-	Use a version column (version INT).
-	Maintain a history table for auditing.


--- 
### Partitioning Strategy

To optimize performance and query efficiency, partition by:

-	Time-based fields (e.g., publication_year)
-	High-cardinality fields (e.g., researcher_id, organization_id)
