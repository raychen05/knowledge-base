## Columnar databases and Row-oriented databases


### 1. Comaparision of Columnar and Row-oriented databases


The primary difference between columnar databases and row-oriented databases lies in how they store and retrieve data. This fundamental difference impacts their performance for specific use cases.


1. Data Storage Format
   
**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Storage: Stores data row by row.
  
```csv
Example: A single row is stored sequentially in memory or disk:
Row1: [ID, Name, Age, Salary] Row2: [ID, Name, Age, Salary]
```
- Ideal Use Case: Designed for transactional systems like OLTP (Online Transaction Processing), where frequent, row-level updates and inserts are common.
  
**Columnar Database**:
- Storage: Stores data column by column.

```csv 
Example: Each column is stored sequentially:
Column1: [ID1, ID2, ID3]
Column2: [Name1, Name2, Name3]
Column3: [Age1, Age2, Age3]
```

- Ideal Use Case: Designed for analytical systems like OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), where aggregations and column-level operations dominate.


2. Query Performance
   
**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Strength: Faster for row-level queries or operations that need entire rows, such as SELECT * FROM.
- Weakness: Slow for analytical queries that involve operations on a single column (e.g., SUM(Salary)), as it must scan all rows and extract relevant columns.

**Columnar Database**:
- Strength: Faster for analytical queries like aggregations, filtering, and summing values in a column.
Only the required columns are read, reducing I/O overhead.
- Weakness: Slow for row-level operations, as it must reassemble rows from multiple column files.

3. Compression

**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Limited compression opportunities because rows usually contain heterogeneous data types (e.g., string, int).

**Columnar Database**:
- High compression rates due to homogenous data types in columns (e.g., all integers).
This reduces storage costs and improves query performance by reducing I/O.


4. Write Performance

**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Fast Inserts/Updates: Optimized for inserting and updating entire rows.
Example: Used in systems where transactional consistency and frequent updates are critical (e.g., banking systems).

**Columnar Database**:
- Slower Inserts/Updates: Not optimized for frequent updates, as changes affect multiple column files.
Often batch data is written instead of individual row writes.


5. Use Cases
   
**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Applications with high transactional workloads (OLTP):
    - Banking systems
    - CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
    - E-commerce platforms
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database

**Columnar Database**:
- Applications with high analytical workloads (OLAP):
    - Data warehousing
    - Business intelligence (BI) tools
    - Real-time analytics
    - Examples: Apache Druid, ClickHouse, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery
  
6. Examples of Operations
   
Example Query: Find the total salary of all employees in a company.

**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Must read all rows, then extract the Salary column.

**Columnar Database**:
- Reads only the Salary column, ignoring others, making it much faster.
- 
Example Query: Find details of employees in a specific department.

**Row-Oriented Database**:
- Retrieves complete rows quickly if indexed.
**Columnar Database**:
- Requires reassembling rows from columnar storage, making it slower.

### 2. Performance of Columnar database - ClickHouse

Columnar databases like ClickHouse can support arrays of string data and efficiently handle search, filtering, and aggregation tasks, though there are some nuances to keep in mind. Here's an overview of ClickHouse’s capabilities:

1. Support for Array Types
   
- ClickHouse supports array types natively, allowing you to store arrays of strings, integers, or other data types within a single column. This makes it highly flexible for representing complex data structures, like multiple authors in a publication, multiple keywords, or various metrics.
- You can use array functions to manipulate and query these arrays, such as arrayJoin() to flatten arrays and perform operations across array elements.

2. Search and Filtering on Multiple Columns

- ClickHouse supports highly efficient filtering across multiple columns. The columnar format helps achieve quick query results when applying filters, even with large datasets.
- It also supports secondary indexes (via sparse indexes) and primary key indexing on columns, which can speed up the filtering and querying process.
- For complex queries with multiple filters, ClickHouse uses parallel query execution across distributed nodes to further improve performance.

3. Aggregating Metrics with Filters

- ClickHouse is specifically optimized for analytical queries and can perform complex aggregations efficiently. Aggregations such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), and percentiles are commonly used in analytical workflows.
- When applying filters on the dataset, ClickHouse performs vectorized processing, which processes multiple rows at a time in memory, allowing for faster aggregation even with a large number of filters or metrics.

4. High-Performance Joins

- ClickHouse supports JOINs but with some limitations. It’s not as optimized for real-time transactional joins as row-based databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), but for OLAP workloads, it can handle joins effectively.
- It supports JOINs on different tables, but the performance will depend on the JOIN type (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) and the data size. For very large datasets, distributed joins are possible, but they may require tuning to balance load across distributed nodes.
- MergeTree tables in ClickHouse can be used with partitions to optimize performance for large datasets, especially when applying joins on large fact tables.


5. Handling Relationships between Tables

- While ClickHouse is not a full-fledged relational database, it can handle relationships between tables using JOINs. However, it is optimized for analytical workloads rather than transactional ones, so for extremely complex relationships (many-to-many or highly normalized data), you may need to handle data denormalization in the ETL pipeline before storing it in ClickHouse.
- Materialized views and aggregating tables can be used to pre-aggregate data or join tables, improving query performance for frequently used relationships and metrics.


6. Performance Considerations

- ClickHouse is designed for high throughput and low-latency performance, especially for real-time analytics. When querying large datasets (like 85 million publications), its columnar storage format, combined with its distributed architecture, allows it to perform real-time data aggregation and filtering efficiently.
- ClickHouse can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple nodes, making it suitable for very large datasets and high-query throughput requirements.
- For high-performance metrics and ranking, ClickHouse can effectively return top N results (e.g., top 20K authors) based on selected metrics and aggregations, even with multiple filters.

**Key Points**:

- Arrays of strings are supported, and operations like arrayJoin allow you to work with these effectively.
- ClickHouse supports efficient filtering and aggregation using columnar storage and indices.
- Joins and relationships between tables are supported but can have performance limitations with large-scale joins.
- Scalability and parallelism make ClickHouse an excellent choice for large datasets and real-time analytics.


In summary, ClickHouse is well-suited for your use case, especially with its ability to efficiently handle filtering, aggregation, and analysis on large datasets (e.g., over 100 million records). However, for more complex multi-table relationships and transactional consistency, you may need to complement ClickHouse with other databases that handle OLTP-style operations better.


### 3. Indexing Multiple Columns in ClickHouse 


ClickHouse does support indexing, but the indexing system is different from traditional row-based relational databases. In ClickHouse, the primary index is typically built on the primary key of the table, which is usually defined by a tuple of columns that uniquely identifies rows. In addition to the primary index, ClickHouse provides secondary indexes and skip indexes to optimize query performance.


1. Primary Index

- Primary Key: In ClickHouse, the primary index is defined when creating a table using the ORDER BY clause. It is not a "unique" index but rather a way of organizing and sorting data. This index helps in the quick retrieval of data based on the sorting order.
- This index is highly effective for filtering or searching on the columns that are part of the primary key.
-  When data is written into ClickHouse, it's sorted and indexed by the primary key in parts (segments of data stored on disk).

2. Secondary Indexes

- ClickHouse allows the use of secondary indexes through sparse indexes. However, secondary indexes are not as effective as primary indexes because they don't perform as well with large-scale analytical queries.
- You can create secondary indexes on multiple columns, which may be useful when frequently filtering by those columns. However, secondary indexes are not always stored in memory and need to be read from disk, which can slow down query performance on large datasets.
- Use Case: Secondary indexes work well for selective queries that frequently filter on specific columns, but for complex queries with multiple filter conditions (especially when using AND/OR combinations), they may not offer significant speed-ups.

3. Skip Indexes

- Skip indexes are a special type of index used in ClickHouse to skip reading blocks of data that do not match a given filter condition. These indexes are more efficient than secondary indexes and are typically used for filtering large data ranges.
- For example, if you're filtering a time range (e.g., between two dates), the skip index can help skip over the irrelevant blocks of data.

4. Limitations with Multiple Indexes

- Multiple Indexes: While you can create indexes on multiple columns, ClickHouse is not as optimized for multiple, high-cardinality secondary indexes across many columns. This can lead to performance degradation, as managing and updating many indexes can become expensive in terms of storage and computation.
Storage Overhead: Maintaining many indexes, especially if they are on highly cardinal data (e.g., strings, large numeric ranges), increases storage requirements, which can degrade performance due to disk I/O and memory usage.
- Index Update Cost: As ClickHouse is optimized for append-only workloads (where new data is constantly being added), maintaining indexes on many columns can introduce additional overhead during inserts, especially if the index needs to be updated frequently.


### 4. Impact of Arrays on Performance

ClickHouse does support array types (e.g., arrays of strings, integers, etc.), but there are some considerations regarding performance when using arrays for search and filtering:

1. Array Operations:

- Array Functions: ClickHouse provides many built-in functions for manipulating arrays, such as arrayJoin(), arrayMap(), arrayFilter(), etc., which allow you to work with array data types effectively.
- Search and Filtering: If you perform searches or filtering on array data, ClickHouse will need to iterate over the elements of the array. This can become computationally expensive when filtering large arrays across many rows.
- For example, querying an array column with a filter condition like WHERE arrayElement IN ('value1', 'value2') can result in slower performance compared to filtering on regular scalar columns.

2. Performance Downgrades:

- Array Size: The larger the arrays, the more data ClickHouse needs to process. If your arrays are large and you frequently query them, this could lead to slower performance.
- Memory Usage: Since arrays are processed in memory, very large arrays can lead to higher memory consumption and, potentially, out-of-memory errors if not properly managed.

3. Optimizing Array Usage:

- ArrayJoin: One common technique to improve performance when working with arrays is to use arrayJoin() to "flatten" the array into multiple rows. However, this can also result in duplicated rows and may impact performance if the array size is large.
- Avoiding Excessive Array Filtering: If possible, it's best to avoid using arrays for highly-filtered columns, or to reduce the complexity of the queries involving arrays.

#### Summary of Key Considerations

1. Indexing Multiple Columns:

- Primary Index: Use it on the most frequently filtered columns. ClickHouse sorts data based on this index and can quickly access rows in this order.
- Secondary Indexes: Can be used for columns that are frequently filtered but might have less performance than primary indexes. Limit the number of secondary indexes on highly cardinal columns to avoid excessive overhead.
- Skip Indexes: Use for filtering on ranges, such as dates or numerical ranges, as these can help skip irrelevant blocks of data.

2. Handling Arrays:

- Array Search/Filter: Can result in performance degradation, especially with large arrays or complex filter conditions.
- Optimization: Consider flattening arrays with arrayJoin() or reducing the complexity of array operations in queries.

3. Trade-offs:

- While indexing on multiple columns and using arrays can provide flexibility and power in querying, there are trade-offs regarding query complexity, memory usage, and insert performance. For very large datasets with complex queries, it's crucial to carefully design indexing strategies and optimize how you store and query array data.

**Conclusion**
ClickHouse is powerful for handling complex queries with multiple filters and aggregations, especially on large datasets, but using too many indexes or complex array operations without careful planning can degrade performance. To achieve the best performance, optimize your schema, choose indexes wisely, and minimize the complexity of queries that involve large arrays or excessive use of secondary indexes.


### 5. Wildcard and Prefix Search on Array Type in ClickHouse

ClickHouse supports a range of operations on arrays, but wildcard and prefix searches—especially on string data inside arrays—require careful handling because of how ClickHouse is optimized. Let's break this down:


1. Wildcard Search on Array Type (String Data)

- Wildcard Search: ClickHouse does not natively support wildcard search (like * or ?) on array types directly using the standard LIKE operator.
- Possible Workaround: You can use regular expressions to perform more complex pattern matching, but this can be slower than traditional string searches and may not work as efficiently for arrays. For example:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_table
WHERE arrayMatch(x -> match(x, '.*prefix.*'), my_array_column);
```
This uses arrayMatch and a regex pattern to match elements in the array that contain the desired substring.


2. Prefix Search on Array Type (String Data)

Prefix Search: ClickHouse can perform prefix matching (e.g., searching for strings that start with a specific prefix) in array columns using arrayMatch with the LIKE operator.

Example
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM my_table 
WHERE arrayMatch(x -> x LIKE 'prefix%', my_array_column);

```
This will return rows where the array contains strings that start with the specified prefix.

**Performance Consideration**:

- Prefix Search on Arrays: Prefix search can still be relatively efficient because the LIKE 'prefix%' is optimized in ClickHouse (as long as the prefix length is not too long or too varied). However, searching on large arrays with many elements could degrade performance, especially if there are many rows in the table or if the arrays themselves are large.
- Inefficient for Complex Queries: Performing LIKE operations on array elements might not be as fast as searching on simple string columns due to the need to scan each element of the array. This performance impact depends on factors such as:
  - Array Size: Larger arrays will require more processing, especially when each array needs to be scanned individually.
  - Row Count: More rows to scan means higher query time.


3. Search Performance Impact

- Array Handling in ClickHouse: While ClickHouse is highly optimized for large-scale data analytics and columnar storage, searching through arrays (especially string arrays) can have performance implications. Since ClickHouse is optimized for sequential scanning and aggregation over columns, scanning arrays for partial matches (wildcards or prefixes) can introduce some overhead.
- ArrayMatch and Memory Usage: Functions like arrayMatch and using regex or LIKE for pattern matching require processing in memory, which can lead to higher memory usage when the arrays are large or the dataset is vast.
- Possible Performance Degradation:
    - Large Arrays: If you have large arrays, particularly in millions of rows, querying for matches or prefixes can result in slower performance compared to regular columnar data types.
    - Join Operations: If your query involves joins or aggregations along with array matching, the performance will degrade due to the overhead of both operations and the processing required to handle arrays.


4. Optimizing Prefix and Wildcard Search

Here are some ways you can optimize searches on arrays of strings in ClickHouse:

1. Using arrayJoin: If you need to perform searches or operations on individual array elements, you can "flatten" the array using arrayJoin(). This allows you to treat array elements as separate rows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
ARRAY JOIN my_array_column AS element
WHERE element LIKE 'prefix%';
```
This flattens the array, making it easier to filter for matches on individual elements. However, this approach may lead to duplicated rows and can introduce performance issues when dealing with large datasets.

2. Data Preprocessing: In cases where you know you will often perform prefix or wildcard searches, you can store preprocessed or tokenized data. For example:

- Store string data in a truncated form (e.g., only storing the first few characters of each string) that will allow faster prefix searches.
- Maintain separate columns for commonly searched data if possible.

3. Use Materialized Views: If you frequently perform wildcard or prefix searches on arrays, you could create materialized views that precompute the results of the searches, which would avoid re-computing them every time. This approach trades storage for speed.

4. Optimize Indexes: Although ClickHouse doesn't support traditional indexing on array columns, using skip indexes or primary key indexing on related fields can still help reduce query times for filter-heavy operations.

**Summary**

- Prefix search on array columns can be performed using arrayMatch with the LIKE operator, and it is generally faster than wildcard search.
- Wildcard search is more complex and requires regular expressions or using arrayMatch with regex, which may degrade performance.
- Performance considerations: Searching through arrays will be slower than searching on flat columns, especially when arrays are large or contain many rows.
- For optimal performance with array searches, consider using arrayJoin() to flatten arrays, indexing strategies, or preprocessing your data to reduce search complexity.

**Key Takeaway**: 

While ClickHouse can support wildcard and prefix searches on arrays, the search performance will depend heavily on the array size, the number of rows, and the complexity of the queries. Optimizing array queries or considering pre-processing strategies can help alleviate performance issues.



### 6. Efficiency of Negative Logic and Complex Boolean Logic in ClickHouse Aggregation

ClickHouse is a columnar database optimized for analytical workloads, including high-performance aggregation over large datasets. However, the efficiency of complex boolean logic, especially involving negative conditions (e.g., negations, complex boolean expressions), can vary depending on how the queries are structured and the nature of the data.

1. Negative Logic in Aggregation (e.g., NOT conditions)

Negative logic, such as using NOT, !=, or negating conditions in WHERE or HAVING clauses, does not inherently degrade performance in ClickHouse, provided that:

- The columns involved in the negation are indexed appropriately or have low cardinality.
- The query execution plan is optimized to scan only the necessary data.

Example of negative logic in aggregation:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM my_table 
WHERE NOT status = 'inactive';
```

In this case, ClickHouse can still handle the query efficiently, especially if it uses skip indexes (if defined on the status column) or partition pruning. However, in certain cases where the negation involves a complex expression or operates over high-cardinality data, performance may degrade slightly due to the increased complexity of the conditions.


2. Complicated Boolean Logic

When boolean expressions are more complex (e.g., involving multiple AND, OR, NOT, and combinations of various conditions), query performance can be impacted depending on the following:

- Cardinality of the columns: If boolean conditions are applied to columns with high cardinality, it could lead to slower performance because more rows need to be processed to evaluate each condition.
- Query structure: If the boolean logic involves multiple conditions combined with OR (especially complex combinations), - ClickHouse might not be able to take full advantage of its columnar storage and indexing mechanisms, which could lead to slower execution.
- Preprocessing requirements: More complex boolean logic might benefit from preprocessing steps, such as materialized views or precomputed flags to avoid repeatedly evaluating complex conditions during aggregation.

Example of complex boolean logic:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM my_table 
WHERE (status != 'inactive' AND region = 'US') 
OR (status = 'active' AND age > 30);
```

In this case, ClickHouse will evaluate both parts of the OR condition, which could slow down the query if either side involves high-cardinality columns or if the dataset is very large. However, if the query is well-indexed or the data is partitioned properly, it can still handle it efficiently.

3. Impact on Aggregation

Boolean logic in aggregation (like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.) often involves applying conditions on rows before performing the aggregation. Complex boolean conditions can impact aggregation performance in the following ways:

- Evaluating Conditions: When you apply complex boolean expressions, ClickHouse needs to evaluate them on every row that’s being considered in the aggregation. If there are many conditions and the rows are large, it can increase the computational load.
- Materialized Views: If you frequently use complex boolean logic for aggregation, materialized views or pre-computed flags can be used to optimize query performance. Materialized views store the results of commonly used expressions, allowing them to be directly queried without recalculating each time.

Example 
```sql
SELECT
    region,
    COUNTIF(status != 'inactive' AND age > 30) AS active_older_than_30
FROM my_table
GROUP BY region;
```
In this example, COUNTIF applies a complex boolean expression, and ClickHouse evaluates it for each row before performing the aggregation. While this can be fast for small datasets, for larger datasets with complex boolean logic, the query might take more time due to the number of rows involved in evaluating the conditions.


4. Tips for Efficient Aggregation with Boolean Logic


To ensure optimal performance when using negative and complex boolean logic in aggregation:

- Indexing: Make sure the columns used in the conditions are indexed or have low cardinality (i.e., they have a small number of distinct values). ClickHouse supports primary key and skip indexes, which can help reduce the number of rows that need to be evaluated.
- Avoid Multiple OR Conditions: If possible, try to simplify your boolean logic to avoid multiple OR conditions, as they can prevent ClickHouse from using efficient optimizations (like partition pruning).
- Use Materialized Views: If certain boolean logic is frequently used in aggregations, precompute it using a materialized view. This allows you to store the result of the boolean expression and avoid recomputing it every time the query runs.
- Denormalize Data: For extremely complex queries, consider denormalizing the data to store precomputed values (e.g., storing a column that marks whether an author is "active" or "inactive") to reduce the need for complex logic during aggregation.
- Optimize Data Types: Use appropriate data types for columns involved in boolean logic. Smaller data types (e.g., UInt8 for boolean flags) can speed up the evaluation of conditions.

5. Performance Considerations

- Query Execution Plan: Always review the query execution plan (using EXPLAIN) to see how ClickHouse is executing your query. This can help you identify any inefficiencies or areas where indexes could be used more effectively.
- Array Logic: If boolean logic involves arrays (e.g., checking if an array contains a specific value), it can be less efficient than operations on simple columns. Consider flattening arrays or using arrayJoin to optimize such queries.

**Summary**

- Negative and Complex Boolean Logic: ClickHouse can handle negative logic (e.g., NOT, !=) and complicated boolean expressions efficiently in most cases, especially if the data is indexed and partitioned properly.
- Performance Impact: The performance of complex boolean logic depends on factors like column cardinality, query structure, and the number of rows involved. Complex conditions involving OR can lead to slower performance, especially with large datasets.
- Optimizations: Use indexing, materialized views, and proper data types to optimize queries that involve boolean logic. Where possible, simplify boolean expressions to avoid unnecessary complexity.


In general, ClickHouse performs well with boolean logic and aggregation, but as with any system, carefully structuring queries and ensuring that the dataset is optimized will help ensure high performance even with complex conditions.
