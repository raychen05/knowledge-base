# Design and Framework for a New Data Pipeline on Databricks and Delta Lake

## Overview
The new data pipeline framework leverages Databricks and Delta Lake to enable near real-time data updates and to support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices. The framework is designed to automatically handle data ingestion, processing, and schema changes, ensuring that data updates are reflected promptly and accurately.

## Architecture Design

### Data Ingestion Layer:
- Sources: Data is ingested from various sources, such as APIs, databases, and streaming platforms like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
- Tools: Apache Spark Structured Streaming on Databricks is used for real-time data ingestion.
- Storage: Raw data is initially stored in Delta Lake on Amazon S3.
- 
### Processing Layer:
- Transformation: Data is processed using Apache Spark jobs running on Databricks.
- Delta Lake: Processed data is stored in Delta Lake format to leverage ACID transactions and efficient querying.
- Schema Management: Delta Lake supports automatic schema evolution, allowing changes in data structure without manual intervention.

### Automation and Orchestration:
- Databricks Jobs: Orchestration of data processing tasks using Databricks Jobs.
- Apache Airflow: Workflow management and automation are handled using Apache Airflow to ensure dependencies and schedules are maintained.

### Monitoring and Alerts:
- Databricks Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of data pipelines using Databricks' built-in tools.
- Alerting: Integration with alerting tools like PagerDuty or Slack for immediate notifications on failures or issues.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Approach

### Version Control:
- Git: All code, including Spark jobs and configuration scripts, is stored in a Git repository.
- Branching Strategy: Use of feature branches, development, and production branches for managing changes.

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Build and Test: Automated testing of code changes using a CI tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Deployment: Automated deployment of Spark jobs and configuration to the Databricks environment using Databricks CLI or REST API.

### Schema Evolution:
- Automated Schema Updates: Delta Lakeâ€™s schema evolution feature automatically handles changes in data structure.
- Schema Validation: Automated validation scripts to ensure schema changes are compatible with existing data and downstream applications.
  
## Message Triggers and Automation

### Event-Driven Architecture:

- Message Queues: Use of message queues (e.g., AWS SQS, Apache Kafka) to trigger data processing jobs upon data arrival.
- Webhook Integration: Webhooks to trigger specific actions or jobs based on events (e.g., new data file arrival).

### Automation Scripts:

- Python/Shell Scripts: Automated scripts to manage data ingestion, processing, and schema updates.
- Cron Jobs: Scheduled tasks for regular maintenance and data processing jobs.

## Detailed Workflow

### Data Ingestion:
- Step 1: New data arrives at the source (API, Kafka topic, etc.).
- Step 2: Data ingestion script triggered by the event writes raw data to Delta Lake on S3.
- Step 3: Schema evolution automatically applied if new fields are detected.

### Data Processing:
- Step 1: Databricks job triggered by the new data arrival event or scheduled time.
- Step 2: Data transformation and aggregation performed using Spark.
- Step 3: Processed data written back to Delta Lake with optimized storage.
  
### CI/CD Process:
- Step 1: Developer pushes code changes to Git.
- Step 2: CI tool runs automated tests on the new code.
- Step 3: Upon successful tests, code is deployed to the Databricks environment.
- Step 4: Databricks jobs updated with the new code and configurations.

### Monitoring and Alerts:
- Step 1: Continuous monitoring of jobs and data quality using Databricks monitoring tools.
- Step 2: Alerts triggered for any failures or anomalies detected.
- Step 3: Automated rollback or error handling scripts executed if necessary.

By implementing this framework, the data pipeline can efficiently handle real-time data ingestion, processing, and schema evolution while maintaining high data integrity and timely updates, meeting the customers' requirements for near real-time data analysis.
