### 3. Description of  Key Points

Whether to store content-level and product-level data in the same Delta Lake or in separate Delta Lakes depends on several factors. Here are some strong reasons to support a separate architecture for storing these two types of data:


#### Data Isolation and Security:

- Access Control: Separating the data into different lakes allows for more granular access control. Teams that need access to content-level data might not need access to product-level data, and vice versa.
- Compliance and Governance: Different data types might have different compliance requirements. Keeping them separate ensures that specific governance policies can be applied appropriately to each dataset.

#### Performance and Scalability:

- Optimized Queries: Storing data separately can lead to better performance for queries and analytics. Each Delta Lake can be optimized for the specific types of queries that will be run on that data.
- Scalability: As data grows, scaling can be managed more effectively. Each Delta Lake can be scaled independently based on the growth and usage patterns of the respective data.

#### Data Lifecycle Management:

- Retention Policies: Different data might have different retention requirements. Keeping them in separate lakes allows for tailored retention policies, archiving strategies, and deletion schedules.
- Storage Cost Management: Separating data can help in managing storage costs more efficiently by applying different storage classes and optimization techniques to each lake based on the data usage.

#### Simplified Data Management:

- Maintenance: Managing, updating, and maintaining schemas and data structures can be simpler when different types of data are isolated. This reduces the complexity and risk of accidental changes affecting unrelated data.
- Backup and Recovery: Backup and recovery strategies can be customized for each type of data, ensuring faster recovery times and reduced data loss in case of failures.

#### Data Quality and Consistency:

- Quality Control: Separate lakes allow for more focused data quality checks and transformations, ensuring higher consistency and reliability of each dataset.
- Consistency: It reduces the risk of data contamination or integrity issues that might arise from having different types of data intermixed.

#### Data Pipeline Complexity:

- Simplified Pipelines: Data pipelines can be simplified when they are designed to handle specific types of data. This reduces the risk of errors and makes debugging and monitoring more straightforward.
- Modular Design: A modular approach to data pipelines aligns well with separate lakes, allowing for independent development and deployment of pipelines for different data types.
