### Notes on Syntax Revisions

- Consistency: Ensure consistent use of checkmarks (✓) and update frequency notation (NRT, Weekly or Daily, Yearly or Quarterly).
- Clarity: Improve clarity by adding spaces and organizing the table for better readability.
- Correction: Remove redundant entries and correct typos (e.g., Grants✓ should be Grants | ✓).

This revised table structure and summary provide a clearer and more organized presentation of the data categories, their features, and update frequencies.
