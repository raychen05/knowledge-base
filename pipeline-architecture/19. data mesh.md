Data mesh is an approach to data architecture that decentralizes data management, treating data as a product and giving responsibility for it to the domain teams who generate and use the data. Instead of a centralized data team owning and controlling all data, data mesh distributes responsibility to various domain teams, allowing them to better manage and serve the specific needs of their business areas.

### Key Principles of Data Mesh

1. Domain-Oriented Data Ownership:

- In a data mesh, responsibility for data is shifted to domain teams, which are the teams closest to the data’s source and business context (e.g., sales, marketing, HR).
- These teams manage their data as a product, making it available for others to consume.

2. Data as a Product:

- Each domain treats its data as a product, with consumers (internal teams or external users) as the "customers."
- Data is curated, well-documented, and accessible, ensuring that users can trust and effectively use the data.

3. Self-Service Data Infrastructure:

- - Data mesh encourages the creation of a self-service data platform that provides the infrastructure for teams to handle their data independently.
This infrastructure includes tools for data discovery, governance, quality, and security, allowing domain teams to operate with minimal friction.

4. Federated Computational Governance:

- Governance is still important in data mesh, but it's federated—meaning it’s applied consistently across domains but with autonomy.
- Centralized governance policies (like security, privacy, and compliance) are enforced while allowing each domain to manage its data in ways that align with their specific needs.

### Benefits of Data Mesh

- Scalability: By decentralizing data management, large organizations can scale data initiatives more effectively. Centralized data platforms can become bottlenecks as data grows, but with data mesh, each domain can scale independently.

- Domain Expertise: Data stays within the domain that understands it best, ensuring higher data quality and more relevant usage.

- Agility: Teams can move faster when they control their own data and infrastructure, rather than waiting for a centralized team to fulfill requests.

### Example

Imagine a retail company with multiple business units like sales, inventory, and customer service. Instead of funneling all data to a centralized team for processing and analysis, each unit manages its own data (sales data, inventory data, customer interaction data). This approach ensures that domain experts can quickly address and manage their specific data needs, while still making their data available to the rest of the organization through standard protocols.

### Data Mesh vs. Traditional Data Architecture

- Traditional Data Architecture: Often involves centralized data lakes or warehouses, where all data flows into a single repository managed by a central team.
- Data Mesh: Distributes data management and allows each domain to manage its data independently while adhering to governance standards.
  
### When to Consider Data Mesh

- When an organization is struggling with scalability and bottlenecks in a centralized data platform.
- When domain teams are requesting more autonomy over their data and have the resources to manage it.
- In large, complex organizations where different departments generate, manage, and use their own data extensively.

Data mesh is a modern approach designed to address the limitations of monolithic, centralized data architectures in a distributed, cloud-native environment.

### Databricks Lakehouse and Data Mesh

Data mesh is a paradigm that describes a set of principles and logical architecture for scaling data analytics platforms. The purpose is to derive more value from data as an asset at scale. The phrase 'data mesh' was introduced by Zhamak Dehghani in 2019 and expanded on in her 2020 article Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture.

At the core of the data mesh logical architecture are four principles:

1. Domain ownership: adopting a distributed architecture where domain teams - data producers - retain full responsibility for their data throughout its lifecycle, from capture through curation to analysis and reuse
2. Data as a product: applying product management principles to the data analytics lifecycle, ensuring quality data is provided to data consumers who may be within and beyond the producer's domain
3. Self-service infrastructure platform: taking a domain-agnostic approach to the data analytics lifecycle, using common tools and methods to build, run, and maintain interoperable data products
4. Federated governance: ensuring a data ecosystem that adheres to organizational rules and industry regulations through standardization


Data products are an important concept for the data mesh. They are not meant to be datasets alone but data treated like a product: they need to be discoverable, trustworthy, self-describing, addressable and interoperable. Besides data and metadata, they can contain code, dashboards, features, models, and other resources needed to create and maintain the data product.

Many customers ask, 'Can we create a data mesh with Databricks Lakehouse?' The answer is yes! Several of Databricks' largest customers worldwide have adopted data mesh using the Lakehouse as the technological foundation.

Databricks Lakehouse is a cloud-native data, analytics and AI platform that combines the performance and features of a data warehouse with the low-cost, flexibility and scalability of a modern data lake. For an introduction, please read What is a Lakehouse?

The lakehouse addresses a fundamental concern with data lakes that led to the principles of a data mesh – that a monolithic data lake can become an unmanageable data swamp. The Databricks Lakehouse is an open architecture that offers flexibility in how data is organized and structured, whilst providing a unified management infrastructure across all data and analytics workloads.

The primary unit of organization within the Databricks Lakehouse platform that maps to the concept of domains in a data mesh is the 'workspace'. A Databricks Lakehouse can have one or more workspaces, with each workspace enabling local data ownership and access control.
