## 🎯 Feature-2: Targeted Impact Recommendations

Recommend concrete, personalized actions researchers can take to increase the impact of their work: including venues, collaborators, topics to expand into, and dissemination strategies.

### 🧠 Purpose

This feature acts as a personalized impact strategy engine that:

* Analyzes a given paper or research profile
* Suggests where to publish, whom to collaborate with, topics to expand into, and how to disseminate findings
* Helps researchers strategically grow their influence and real-world impact

### ✅ Input Format (JSON)

```json
CopyEdit

### 🧠 Realistic LLM Prompt Template

```text
CopyEdit
You are a research impact strategist. Given a research paper, recommend a personalized plan for increasing its academic and real-world impact.

Your output should include:
1. Journals or venues to publish in (with justification)
2. Potential collaborators (with name, affiliation, and why they are relevant)
3. New research directions or topics to expand into
4. Dissemination strategies (e.g., public engagement, policy outreach, media)

Make recommendations specific to the content of the paper.

Title: {title}
Abstract: {abstract}
Keywords: {keywords}
Author Affiliation: {author_affiliation}
Field: {field}

Respond in the following JSON format:
{
  "recommendations": {
    "venues": [...],
    "collaborators": [...],
    "topics_to_expand": [...],
    "dissemination_strategies": [...]
  }
}
```


### 🧑‍💻 Python Backend Example (with OpenAI)


```python

from typing import List, Dict

def recommend_impact_strategy(
    title: str,
    abstract: str,
    keywords: List[str],
    author_affiliation: str,
    field: str
) -> Dict:
    prompt = f"""

        temperature=0.4
    )

    import json
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message["content"])


# Example call
if __name__ == "__main__":
    output = recommend_impact_strategy(
        title="A Transformer-based Framework for Predicting Plant Disease Resistance Genes",
        abstract="We propose a deep learning architecture that uses genomic sequences...",

    )
    from pprint import pprint
    pprint(output)
```


### 💡 Bonus: Hybrid Mode with Search + LLM

To improve accuracy, you can precede LLM generation with:

1. FAISS: Retrieve similar impactful papers and strategies from your own case-base.
2. Elasticsearch: Match venues or collaborators based on indexed metadata.
3. Citation graph: Use co-citation or co-authorship networks to suggest collaborators.
4. InCites/Web of Science API: Enrich suggestions with actual impact metrics.
5. 
Use these as additional context in the LLM prompt.


### 🧰 Optional: LangChain Agent Integration

You can wrap this into a LangChain tool:

```python
CopyEdit
from langchain.tools import Tool

impact_strategy_tool = Tool(
    name="TargetedImpactRecommendations",
    func=recommend_impact_strategy,
    description="Recommend actions to maximize impact of a research paper including venues, collaborations, new directions, and outreach."
)
```

### Would You Like:

* A FastAPI backend for this?
* A Streamlit UI to input paper details and show recommendations?
* Integration with Web of Science/InCites to improve collaborator or venue suggestions?
*
